We are being asked to sacrifice for the good of our families , our friends , our neighbors , the paramedics , doctors , and nurses . If these people who insist on physically going to church , they have the right to do that . But then they should stay in their homes so they do n‚Äôt spread their ‚Äú freedom ‚Äù to the rest of us . And they should not use up a hospital bed or a ventilator or put the lives of doctors and nurses in jeopardy . 
If you truly carry God in your heart then he is where you are all the time . Whether you are in your home alone or with your family . When you pray he hears you . You do n't have to be gathered together exposing yourself to the virus ravaging countries right now . Stay home . Pray . Have faith . 
I love the lord in all his glory ! But this stuff is real they will learn when those who continue to go in large groups get sick themselves ! Smh ü§¶ üèΩ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è when you have it you will say awww man ..... I would n‚Äôt wish this on Anyone ! ! ! Then you ‚Äôll regret doing the opposite of what has been preached to you about the warnings ! ! 
seems like they are trying to be creative and still maintain social distancing . Has everyone forgoten our constitution ? Our rights ? Did we change the name of our country and our government ? 
There are other ways in worshipping and building our faith through these crazy times . Thankfully online sessions 
It is Not a Happy Easter , for most .. may GOD be with those whom are grieving , may god give who are first responders strength to do their jobs right and make the right choices with each paitent . May our Nation find unitity and unite with their decisions ‚Ä¶ mai mult 
‚Äú I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense , reason , and intellect has intended us to forego their use . ‚Äù

God is not only confined inside churches ! If you truly believe in God , then you know he is everywhere . 
Follow the rules .... so you do not want to , but then everyone else pays . We want to go to church and maybe to our families homes but we do n't for the the good of all . Many people have died and sacrificed so that one day we all could enjoy some kind of normal life sooner not later . Let 's see how many people transferred virus . 
Maybr plans to finance birth control in countries that can not sustain their populations . Where people are starving due to the countries inability to provide food . 
If any of their friends or family , not to mention any others they come in contact with , develop or sadly die of this it will be on these folks shoulders . God gave you a brain to think with and common sense says stay home ... he can not do everything for you when you ignore this threat . 
KANSAS , ARKANSAS , LOUISIANA OPENED CHURCHES . PUT THE PASTORS IN PRISON OR TAKE THEM TO A HOSPITAL WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM THE VIRUS AND SEE IF THEY CAN SAVE LIVES . 
What 's in those hidden gatherings has got nothing to do with Christ . OMG ! My family would never miss our Easter Mass ! We did n't ! We had it on TV ! üíï I have n't felt such love as today ! This Easter Sunday ! True love ! üíï

You ca nt livestream healthcare or groceries . But you can livestream church . These people need to think about the country and not themselves . 
If you 're sheltered in  and adhering to the guidelines , their actions do n't affect you . 
So , what 's the problem ? 
Worshipping God does n't not have to occur within a physical structure ! 
These people must remember that we the people are the church . The building is just a meeting or gathering  . You can worship God in your home and he will hear your praises and worship 
I do nt wish illness on anyone , not even the Orange Wanna Be King but if these people get sick oh well ü§∑ üèª‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è 
So . People are going to Church despite " no gathering " orders ? ? It 's almost like they do n't want someone telling them what to do with their bodies ... ‚Ä¶ .. Almost like they are " Pro Choice " . Except One of them can affect the lives of at least Five others and their loved ones . 
My wife ‚Äôs church had service on line but also in the parking lot . You were not allowed to get out of your car they had speakers set up and told to honk after the sermon . 
know that church is wherever you are . The building is just a shell . You do n‚Äôt have to be there to worship and praise God ! ! ! My church has been celebrating and worshipping God ONLINE , LIVE STREAM since they put ‚Äú stay in  ‚Äù order . 
Allow congregation and ban the collecting of monies in any form . 
It ‚Äôs ridiculous that anyone would look down upon a church for celebrating Easter , and say they are ignoring social distancing rules when you know everyone of you have been to Walmart . 
I hope these are the only people in their community who die from Coronavirus . 
Now is not the time for a pope in a castle . Pandemic needs science and social activity . Front liners , food supply , hygiene , and discipline are paramount . 
I celebrated Mass from the safety of my living room . As much as I love physically being in church , it 's just not worth it right now . 
I really wish people would pay attention to the church in GA who did n‚Äôt follow social distancing and  members contracted Covid and two senior members of the church died because of it . But hey , it ‚Äôs your right . 
If your god can not see you in your own home , maybe choose a different god . I think the Christian one might be a good alternative since that god is everywhere according to the texts . 
No matter how a country system look like , it 's all depend on the country Leader & Adminstration works ! We all are inter connected around the world . We hope every countries can work together and grow in prosperity and stay healthy always . Stay positive ! 
There 's is n't many things more two faced than religion ... 
awesome great , let them gather hug kiss and shake hands .. as long as they infect each other and no one else .. i'm okay with that .. #GoPrayTheVirusAway ! üôè :) 
It is so terrible what has been caused to the people ... no guts .that someone could cause all of this and someone could let it happen . 
When they congregated and get sick they ‚Äôre going to blame it on government and if they ‚Äôre okay they will say God has mercy on them

He is cool about the stay at home orders . 
After all he did n‚Äôt rise for you to get Coronavirus . 
If they do can they please at least stay quarantine for  days . And not put others in jeopardy . 
is real but the reaction to is politically driven ..... wake up fools . This virus has been spreading through the population since last year . 
How can attending mass be more important than social distancing ? ? You can talk to God from your bedroom , if you want to . No time for ritualistic gatherings . Sorry 
Wise church leaders are n‚Äôt putting their congregations in harms way . 
What ever happened to freedom of religion ? ü§î Oh wait , they 're trying to take that away from us too ! ü•¥ 
Which will extent the quarantine another two weeks or more because we have to start back at zero after the exposure 
They should all be going to church as is their undeniable , nonnegotiable , Constitutional right 
Good to see these take back their first amendment right . 
winners . 
God is not just inside a church building . Why show ignorance when it is not necessary . 
It seems ironic to me that the USA fought wars recently in the Islamic Middle East and put them down as bad folks . Now some folks tout their religion in the USA and defy their government and risk lives in the name of Christianity . That 's decked up ! 
Why do you people think you need a church to observe god ! ! 
The collection plate is valued more than the person . 
There are no gods . All gods are man made . 
And . were Republicans . Reckless towards others

far back as late November , U.S. intelligence officials were warning that a contagion was sweeping through China ‚Äôs Wuhan region , changing the patterns of life and business and posing a threat to the population , according to four sources briefed on the secret reporting .

In the name of the Merciful God Hi is only a very weak virus , but by your fear of it and your followers of Satan 's steps , you made him a deadly killer . is a manipulated virus that is d inside the planted eggs Therefore , whoever wants to stop the spread of this virus , he must stop eating imported imported eggs , as well as cans of tuna , canned fish Most likely the eggs are the main cause of the spread of the virus The proof is what I say  . How this virus reached the submarine crew  . How he arrived to the crew of the American flagship in the middle of the oceans  . How did he reach the affected cruise ships ? .How it spread in the tourist cities in Italy and Europe  . Iran is not the largest importer of Chinese eggs  . The countries of the world are not the largest consumers of processed eggs What is common for all of these people is eating processed eggs or tuna , most likely 
the doors , burn them down !
