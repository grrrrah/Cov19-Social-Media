He is woefully illequipped to handle a crisis of this magnitude or the country for a matter of fact and that goes for his administration as well . Due toTrump 's narcasistic personality and his inability to listen and heed the advice of the medical subject matter experts our country and its citizens will continue to suffer in all regards . Medically , financially and economically ...

My heart goes out to all Americans and their families losing their loved ones . Personally I did n't expect any deaths in USA , this is a country so advanced in all ways . I thought the leadership would control it right from the start , immediately China locked down . Very disappointing . My heart goes out to the families . 
It ‚Äôs called chaos , panic , hair on fire . He is completely panicked with no idea what to do so he chooses to shift blame , point fingers , criticize , fire people ...... absolutely no leadership whatsoever . New Yorkers should be forever grateful for Gov. . He has been focused and on the task at hand every moment . New York will survive in spite of trump not because of him . 
Here in Canada , we pray for our friends from the United States . It is so sad to see the situation getting worse every day . You are a great nation and have hope . You deserve better than this . 
No point constantly refferring to the Most tragic day .... unless you plan on repeating that same headline for the next few months . 
Your president is at fault for lack of action and stealing medical supplies from other countries . You need a better one , the insane " was nt me " grandpa is nt working out 
What is seen of the USA today is like the last days of the Roman empire . Corruption , nepotism , vested interests driving government policy , loss of empathy towards its citizens . A President like DT is but a symbol of the malaise . Yours is a great country . Please save it for all our sakes . 
Unbelievable . He is in a full gallop now . Not a shred of fear , not an ounce of decency . We have  months to go of what will effectively be an autocrat . God help us . 
If he does n't lose hugely in the next election ... We 'll deserve whatever happens to us during his ( God Forbid ) nd term . 
As

This is the guy who described the coronavirus a little flu and said by coming April and warmer weather it would be disappeared ! :/

Why has n‚Äôt someone in our government stood up and said he is severely destroying our country and hold him accountable immediately ? ? ? Get him out of office now before he makes this any worse . If our government wo n‚Äôt do anything about it maybe we as citizens should march on Washington and remove him ourselves . # wethepeople 
I think this tragedy has helped me to ascertain how unprepared some journalist are . Several times journalist ask a question , trump asks for more specific information such as a number or name and they do n't have it . He makes them look irresponsible . And frankly , I feel similarly . I am not a supporter but if I were to attend his press conference , I would b ed armed and ready . 
Undermining the authority of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government during a time of national crisis is treason . CNN it 's not a news agency it is an anti American propaganda agency . 
Keep the clown away from the press meetings . His using it as a political BS . MAY HE ROT IN HELL

Is opinion stories bashing the president the only thing CNN is capable of producing anymore ? No more real news stories ? 
This article is complete biased , elitist drivel and opinion pieces such as this do NOTHING to help our society at such a difficult time . CNN should be ashamed of themselves .

Those deep state so called doctors will be disgraced at the end of this for exploiting this flu to shut down the economy and help the democrat politically 
All the reporters should get together at the daily briefings and only ask the questions to the doctors and if trump does n't allow them then do n't ask the question . Also press stop asking questions not related to covid . This will make not able to spread his false lies
