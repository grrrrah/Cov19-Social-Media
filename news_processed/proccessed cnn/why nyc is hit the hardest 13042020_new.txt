Many are in the eye üëÅ of the storm ‚òî Ô∏è ‚õà and have front line jobs , living paycheck to paycheck and , have little to no health care insurance . All stimulus money üí∞ should have been money used for a proper health care system for everyone before the Covid episode . We pay enough taxes to at least deserve that much . 
One detail that the opinion misses is that / of all rush hour commuters in NYC , use public transportation . 
The city was also slow in closing schools and limiting travel and operations altogether . 
During this key moments of the spread of the disease , it was free to move alongside the millions of people that took public transit during those early days . 
The two countries most devastated by the disease are Kongs and Queens , which is where the working people of the city reside . It so happens that those same two are where the majority of the commuters of color reside ; this is where the two considerations intersect and where race and medical coverage appear to be the causes , where they are just another ingredient . The crowding inside the subway , even two weeks ago , was unbelievable . Even the cleaning of the subway cars and the use of protection for the crews was very late . It should be considered by the author . 
As an American it is sad to hear that some have less quality health care . And we know both government run and private healthcare will both have pros and cons . It is still sad when people are suffering . 
How about  ? It is City that has it the worst . Sure there are a lot of factors like density , pollution , health problems ‚Äî but they have one thing over every other major city . The fact that the people there breathed those fumes , dust and k ‚Ä¶ Vezi mai mult 
The easiest and most obvious explanation is usually the correct one . NYC ‚Äôs population density is insane . Everyone is packed in together and everyone takes public transit . A lot more opportunities for transmission . Even in Los Angeles , we ‚Äôre pretty spread out compared to NYC

and Unheeded Warnings Hindered ‚Äôs Virus Fight 
The federal response was chaotic . Even so , the state ‚Äôs and city ‚Äôs own initial efforts failed to keep pace with the outbreak , The Times found 
NYC is also a state that uses public transportation more than any other state . Getting on a bus or subway train looks like a clown car . Pt and density will be a major factor . 
Right . A high rate of obesity has nothing to do with it . High rates of heart disease has nothing to do with . following guide lines has nothing to do with it . It 's all ' fault . It 's all ' fault . It 's all 's fault .. peep .. peep .. says the ! 
Capone 
the most likely explanation is the fact that city and state officials were telling people to go about their daily lives . In MARCH . 
Because political leaders encouraged citizens to ride the subway and attend parades . 
‚Äôs CP was allowing citizens to fly all over the world infecting all of us . 
I thought I was paying absorbent ACA premiums to help those that ca n‚Äôt afford to have cheap ACA insurance . You ‚Äôre telling me it did n‚Äôt work . 
Because the powers that be have n't called for a mandatory quarantine . Then you have the nasty folks whom are just discarding gloves and masks all about the streets . Lock it down for two weeks or more if necessary and start issuing fines to folks whom are disobeying the rules 
Excuse our arrogance as Yorkers ‚Äî I speak for the mayor also on this one ‚Äî we think we have the best health care system on the planet right here in , ‚Äù Mr. said on March  . 
It was and downplaying it and telling people to go about their business . 
Just wait , just wait , while NYC get 's a grip on things , every other state in this country is going to get hammered far worse that they ever thought they could be . 
It is going to be more awful than anyone can believe . 
My cousin does n't work and has Medicaid . He has been to the hospital for detox numerous times and  time for  weeks and never paid a dime . Fake News ! ! ! ! !

NY  days to lockdown the state , allowing the virus to spread . 
just the beginning sadly and unfortunately it will hit all the states I hope I 'm wrong I 've been saying for almost one month guys you need to shut down the whole country lock down completely but it 's too late now I hope set motorhome guy may bless their soul and have mercy on us and have and well been living people in this planet 
Well one reason is likely because the Mayor and the Governor dismissed COVID as being no worse than the flu back in early February after the President had already banned travel from China in January ! 
It 's a simple fact it 's caused by habitual behaviors like Smoking Cigarettes and Marijuana . The PC Police wo n't tell you the truth they 'll just make it a broken government issue to Deflect and spare peoples feelings . 
Because they did n‚Äôt take it seriously , I remembered , the Mayor was saying go out this is under control .. 
It ‚Äôs because is an incompetent governor 
Could it be the elevators , the subways , the busses ? ? Los Angeles does n‚Äôt have these numbers , we drive our own cars . 
It might also be that the USA has a very high % of elderly people with contributing health factors 
City officials have no idea how many people are living on top of each other in poor , underserved neighborhoods . Sanctuary policies have taken their toll on struggling communities . 
Inadequate healthcare ? I thought was the model for the nation , with its open arms to illegal , unvetted immigration . 
They are counting if you have COVID and died a COVID death weather or not you died from it . 
Also they are not testing everyone ‚Ä¶ Vezi mai mult 
Are there numbers I 'm the amount of people that have died and we 're also in a poor state of health . 
We have chronic diseases running rampant in this country along with incredibly unhealthy lifestyles . 
And before anybody says anything , I already know I 'm a terrible person . 
This virus is definitely looking for the weak and you ca n't blame the virus for that . 
Since moving forward we have to deal with this and possibly other recurrences or viruses people really need to take personal responsibility for their habits . 
Why does n‚Äôt report on how good of a job our president is doing for a change . Always trying to make it seem like is the bad guy when in reality he ‚Äôs done a great job . He knew it was a pandemic before The fake news like were reporting on it and were too busy with their fake impeachment . 
So gets no blame because , he 's a Democrat and his brother works for , right ? NOTHING TO SEE HEAR , FOLKS . 
Why is it so bad ? has been run by Democrats for the most part for decades . I thought Democrats have all the answers . They do n't ? 
Or ... it could most likely be the chronically inept leadership ... the ones that were telling everybody to go out on the town and to parades ü§î 
This is a sad commentary . One would hope most people have access to good healthcare and peoples choices are the issue 
Stop trying to use this to push socialized medicine . The reason is because there are over  million people living in tiny spaces and pushing around all over each other in public spaces . Also , it did n't help matters that the mayor of NYC and governor of NY had a very liberal approach in leaving the city and state open for way too long after the pandemic hit this country . NYC should have been on lockdown about  weeks before the mayor and governor took any action . Pathetic . 
It 's pretty simple .  million people in NYC literally living on top of each other . You can not go anywhere in NYC and not be surrounded by people . 
What ? No . For this particular virus , it 's having a lot of people in a very small , confined space . 
because the mayor and health officials kept telling people to attend parades and gatherings ü§∑ üèª‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è
