Please follow the logic of the medical community . Your state and local officials are doing just that . They could care less about how popular these decisions make them . Be grateful they want to save your life , not exploit it for egotistical gain . 
and , I implore you , please do what you feel is best for our citizens ! ! We know trump will not ! It ’s the almighty dollar that guides him ! 
, K 
That ’s where put it when he had no clue how to handle this ! ! Most have done an outstanding job ! ! 
A Mon Avis 
A Mon Avis and governors need to stay strong .  seems way too soon . 
of the House has shown his true colors : HE CANNOT LEAD .. 
.. so sad for Our Country .. 
WE TRUST . 
keep him from opening the states on st an not until the doctors an scientists say to do it . All he cares is his economy an the stock market that ’s the only platform him to run on for his re election which now in shambles so he ’s trying to bring it back up thinking this wil help him . 
Bravo ! ! ! Stay strong mayors and governors ! Know your power and trust your gut ! Do you own research ... do not depend on DT 
And I hope the have more sense than listening to the man who points to his head and says that is where his decision is coming from , let 's listen to the medical experts , please be sensible . 
Thank god the governors have the power as they care about saving lives ! 
This shady real estate developer with no government knowledge is more concern in his re_election than the lives of Americans . 
It not what he wants , it is up to the to decide when and how systematically they are going to go about it ! 
strong governors . Reopening the country prematurely will restart the cycle , and Coronavirus wins . 
’s are way smarter and more knowledgeable ( Governor ) than POTUS . 
There are many governors that have shown far more leadership than . He does n’t possess the skill set to lead . 
firm governors and mayors ! 
Thank d for the governors who had the courage to make hard decisions .... unlike the WH . 
I 'm glad the governors have the power since most of them have the sense to listen to the experts . 
McNealy 
McNealy do n't open the country until it is safe to do so , period ! stand firm governors ! 
Yeah , he needs to reopen all his businesses , real estate , hotels , resorts and golf courses . Such a fine , self serving man . 
Hopefully the governors can hang on for what ’s going to protect Americans since is n’t protecting us ! 
Thank god for the leadership shown by many governors and mayors in the face of trumps absolute incompetence 
He never closed anything down , so how could he open it back up ? 
He was too scared to make his followers mad by closing it so he made the do it . Now he wants to be the hero and say he opened it . Typical ! 
Sr . 
Sr . Thank Goodness for Governor 's and mayor 's who know is full of Chit . 
He wo nt be deciding for my family when its safe I can assure you of that 
The last thing any human being on Earth wants to know is that they were expendable under President 
Let people get back to work we 're not a communist country vote those mayors governors out 
More failed leadership . He did n’t act to close anything so what can he reopen ? 
So what you 're saying is are responsible for the current deaths , thanks for letting us know . 
They should listen to the President . He ’s been right for the last yrs 
and governors had to rise to the occasion since was n't doing anything about the virus spreading . 
your ground governor 's that care Dr. EVIL does n't care ! ! 
Chua 
Chua yes trump let it open . people need money and they want to comeback to work really bad . 
You do n't have an economy without people and people are dying . 
your ground and stat strong . is with us . 
Thank goodness the mayors and governors are in charge of their own jurisdictions ! 
Well he said the states should take the lead not the feds . 🤷 🏽‍ ♂ ️ 
Maybe all the red states should go first and we can see how it goes . 
Follow the advice of your governors , they have a much better idea what condition their state is in . The other guys advise is 
misleading ! 
political careers do not depend on sacrificing the lives of their residents as much as political career does . 
Pounder 
all the  use all their powers and take care of their states as they are now . 
It takes a village . We all know it 's time for to take a back seat & fade away . It 's necessary for our survival . 
It 's part of his plan to blame the and take no responsibility . 
on ! Nature does nt care about economy ! Protect your people first ! 
Let ’s open the country have trump family will be the first one to walk around th Crowd without mask and gloves . 
How can you reopen something you never shut down ? 
Look most of American would n’t trust trump with the time of day . 
He is very much conserned about the economy not the welfare of the Americans 
of shutdown also lies with and mayors . 
He gives  hour mumbling gibberish press conferences but ultimately will not do much because he does n't want to take responsibility . I guess we should be thankful for that because if he was running this it would be worse . He has done diddly squat to help the people of this country . 
those governors . Protect your family . Ignore the nut in the House . Use common sense and be patient . It ’s worth waiting until we are truly safe . 
Thank goodness for our local leaders . There has been a complete lack of federal leadership and vision to bring our nation through this nightmare . Many governors and mayors were the first to heed medical data and take swift action and raise the alarm to protect the populace . That leadership should not be forgotten . 
Hopefully our great will continue to listen to medical experts and show that his wishes are irrelevant . 
not OF WHICH HE TRIES TO MUDDLE THROUGH ! 
Thank this might not be ’s decision to make and thank some Governor ’s care more about their citizen ’s health and welfare rather then being re elected . 
Most of the have more brains than #  . 
Thank for governors and mayors . They will uphold their promise to serve and protect their citizens . 
Thank for the Tri state who put lives above money and have greater power than you know who to enforce what 's best . 
A plea to all the governors DO NOT LISTEN TO & ADMINISTRATION . Think for your people first . The economy will follow . Please heed all advisory from WHO , CDC , Public & other Medical officials . They know best . You need healthy wise people to get back the economy . 🙏 
Della 
n't open back up until a is clearly cleared up . Are life depend on it . The death polls need to be at  % then and only than will we be safe out here . 
did n’t want to take ownership , he should be thinking how to get medical supplies for our Americans to be tested . He is useless ! ! Bravo for the governs and mayors . 
not kill any more lives , how about listening to the Medical Experts ! 
Child 's 
Child 's There are about  States that will do anything trump wants . We ’ll be right back were we are now . 
And this potential showdown will show trump who holds the power . Not him . 
together and ... you and only you know what ’s going on in your states and cities . dRump can only wish it away in his fantasyland . ! 
Yes , it 's important that people go back to work . But if it 's not safe to go back to work , than no . I 'll never listen to trump , or follow his orders because he only cares about money , not people . I 'll listen to my governor . He will listen to scientists and pay attentiion to facts . He will do it slowly . I 'm lucky I have a governor I trust . 
They should allow his followers to test the water first see what happens , so we can determine if safe for the rest of us . Just a suggestion . 
Thank you to all the and who listen to the pandemic experts to help their people . 
. should be with the people and state and local level and not the federal government 
Thank the heavens the and mayors are the ones who decide ! ! ! 🙏 🏽 
I pray that the governors will stand strong and do what is right for their residents . does not have our welfare in mind . 
We trust the and governors . They have our health / Economy in their beliefs , not re election . 
We need all our to stand strong to keep our people in our states safe ! 
is too soon to reopen , we need testing for the people ! Thank you 
Better to listen to the wind ... than to waste time with the words of a fool . & , Dune : House Atreides 
It ’s not feds reopening the whole nation it ’s a gentle rolling back encouraging each governor in each state to honestly assess and balance their lower than anticipated numbers with economic suicide and its longer lasting effects . Maybe giving their individual citizens choice and not a blanket quarantine and trusting that those who are in the at risk groups will continue to isolate themselves 
For 's sake why are n't we demanding 's resignation . Governor and almost come to tears when talking about the deaths everyday , so much pain and loss of life . 😓 
Thank god . 
I ’m very glad I live in Massachusetts where we are governed by an intelligent humanitarian , . 
is a man who fingerd to WHO , now tries to reopen states for his re election aim unlike fell to save Americans lives . 
Those governors are nt doing anything to help with peoples bills . The country might open without these governors permission . Maybe the federal government can help us go back to work with help from the national guard . Those governors are nt freezing rents or providing food so they can eat this shut down . The governors are nt doing that good either . 
Sr . 
Sr . The Country ’s health and well being is at risk ... 
Thank goodness the have the power . Red states will probably follow 🤬 🤬 
. Why did n't they shut down their states and cities earlier enough to minimize the pandemic . This is not the right time for politics , resistance and activism . 
He should tour the disaster zones first 
Well he forfeited all the control and power to the governors , did n’t he ? ? ? Just by taking no responsibility for anything , to say nothing about all the active harm he ’s inflected on this country regarding the virus . I trust Governor . He ’s done a great job and will continue to watch over Ohioans ! 
It ’s amazing to me that said at one point it ’s the governor ’s decision now he wants to tell them what to do he is nuts people 
I am 's Political Commentary

Many repug govenors have n't bother to shut their system down now and some of the ones that are will follow whatever dump says when he says with zero regards for their citizens . 
The should make the decision they know what ’s going on in there states . I commend Governor of NJ he is doing a great job . 
luck with that #  do n't think any of these or are listening to YOU besides it 's you do n't have the power to open up State 's right 
they know their states better than the federal government , even if some have not used that knowledge 
He is leaving all the medical supplies up to each state so why not decisions like this 🤪 
Exactly ! They are the ones who can take the real credit for areas that took action early and did n't wait on our ' Leader ' for guidance . I 'm sure most will know when it will be safe to reopen . Businesses as well have the leeway to stay closed if they can afford to if things are still uncertain when he wants to open everything back up . I 'm just praying daily this situation will improve soon 🙏 
the governor 's keep saying no to trump . is all for the money in his pocket . He does n't care about the health of the people . 
should listen to Gov. instead of FoxNews . If he had , i am certain that thousands of lives would have been saved . 
That 's so he does n't have to pay all the unemployment benefits and Americans checks that were promised . If you do n't believe that well the health professionals are still waiting and crying over PPE supplies that was allotted in this  trillion dollar relief . 
Thank goodness for the State who have far more integrity than the POTUS . 
How he thinks the " economy " will prosper when everyone is dead is beyond me . 
Thank goodness the and can take charge ! 
Shaw 
Shaw is in a bad spot at this time , he cares but also wants to keep the country ’s economy booming . It ’s a balancing act . 
to the governors and mayors who are looking after their constituents ! No matter what the clowns are saying , you will never go wrong if you listen to your conscience and your people . , surround yourself with smart people so you can ask any questions , and make the right decisions . 
“ and mayors hold the power to enforce closures” ...... then why did n’t they or still have n’t done so ! The next presidential election night is going to be must see tv on cnn watching your heads explode when wins in a landslide ! From Canada with love ! 
All trump is concerned with is the election . He does n't give a cap about anyone but himself . What a shocker . 
He wanted to let the governors run their state during this crisis and did n't want to " interfere . " Well , he got his wish ! :) 
Sadly we in Florida are in the hands of Orange ’s puppet ... 
He will do whatever “ says ” . 
We do n’t have a “ ” on our side , fighting for us . 
I doubt governor 's would side with him on this to the detriment of their citizens . 
to governors ! ! ! He just want the stocks to go up and his money flowing . He cares nothing about the people 🤬 
I ’m not going out until they get a vaccine , because I ’m in very high group ! ! 
My mother has taken a stronger stance on protecting the public than trump . He is a waste of oxygen . 
No one tries more than Governer . He is straight as a dye , he levels with everyone , he would make a great President . 
tRUMP 's one & only one card he plays : economy to win the reelection . Rest including human lives is secondary 
does n't have the power to close and open the country . Regardless , I 'm taking my advice from the scientists regardless of what he says or does . 
Some things are just plain difficult for him to understand . I think he wants to have a total clearance . 
Do not open . And aftershocks it 's gone we have to wait more until we open borders and airports . Others countries have to be clear on it . 
strong governors , we need to be smart , that guy is n't . 
I think some business owners may be more concerned about their employees and customers . 
I feel for people in states whose governors do n't understand how dire things are , who do n't believe in science , and do n't put The People first . 
Wales 
will be open tomorrow . 
This guy ( ) is ALL about the $ $ $ . You ca n't take that with you when u die ! Lives are more important than Money ! 
Does n't Federal Law state law ? 
G.u . 
G.u . I think its about time to open in order not to subside the economy but they 've to observe the parameters that will impose by the mayor and governor on there level for the sake of their constituents . 
not realize he is mentally disturbed , and not capable of running a nation ? 
Font 
how nicely he treated you when you asked for help ! 
I swear is working with China and . 
There 's so many people who unable to be tested and unable to get healthcare . We might open late June 
As they should ! See , this is why you do n't want more per centralized ! !

With all the people who are dieing he do nt care if he could open the Country but he ca nt . 
We needs to test everyone before opening 
To make sure people be sefe ... 
will follow suit and we will spike again but will lose the election for doing this . 
Here is California governor and mayor doing a great job do n't listen to the pink clown 
There are alot of states especially Florida who refused to listen to the countries health crisis do n't blame alot of states are Behind in meeping there states safe ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
Protecting public health or infringing on constitutional rights ..... 
Whatever the governors decide he can override ! ! ! ! But he says the governors should have done more ... am I confused ? ? ? 
We do n't care about non essential blue states ! They can suffer with what they voted for ! 
I find it ironic that the guy who said it was in the hands of the states to shut things down and that he would n’t take on that responsibility at a national level now believes he has the authority to open things at a national level ... 
Let ’s see how the countries that open up early fare and look to science , not economics . I ’m spending money on food , bills , online shopping just fine ... 
said he could n't enforce stricter rules on the states because he ' Loves the Constitution ' . ( If he has even read it ) 
So that same argument can be used by the if he try 's to get them to open things too quickly . 
If anything gets done it will be done by and Individual States . can handle anything but a Golf Club . 
Springer 
’s open  ! I ’m over  and not afraid ! If you are fearful then stay home ! 
Thank you to our govenors . Did not realize how important they are till we got stuck with a pile of orange crap for president . 
Reign 
said he wants to make decisions on closings . Well he can let decide on openings . 
now you want to admit this but wait how is the federal govt at fault when govenors have all the power ? ? ? 🧐 🤔 
At this point , i do n't know why they still broadcast  news briefings . Seriously , we should only get it from our governors . 
your ground on this . has caused the death of many by two other major errors of judgement , either by accident or on purpose . Do n't let him do it again ! Protect us from him ! 
pushed his screw up onto the governor 's , they should have the final say when things return to normal not him . 
So dRumpf will only take responsibility for “ re opening ” the country 
Thank for holding ground to do the balancing act ! was right to step down , and hand it to ! He should give them all the cards , and stick to golf . 
How about the blue states stay closed , including the borders , let the red states open . Call it an experiment 
Acts tough but he 's not really he is n't in charge of this disaster the governors have figured him out and will do what they want . 
Mostly it ’s the states controlling everything . The lockdown and school closings ole Rumpus did NADA . 
He needs his hotels and golf clubs to be open ASAP . That 's all that counts . 
Let 's do what is right for the American people and it is safe we can not lose anymore people . 
Who gives a chit what trump wants . He did n’t give a chit for for  months then in the middle of March he pretends to care . Less than a moth later you can see he ’s done caring again ! 
If pushes too soon , most will stay home and the 🐑 🐑 🐑 will be in trouble . I do n’t wish it upon anyone , but is clearly only thinking about his election and not about you and me . I ’ll figure it out , and I ’ll do my best to help you figure it out . But , I wo n’t go out into the Covid for ... NEVER ... and I hope you do n’t either . 
does not care about the human race only about all the money he is currently losing plus all golf he is missing ! !

if you reopen soon under an unclear situation and more people would get infection , the condition will get worse soon and you will re close it and restart from zero . 
Here comes the blame shifting to the mayors and medical people and scientists 
June st . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! opening too soon will only prolong and compound the problem . We should not have to close for a second time ! ! ! You think the economy is bad now ! ! ! bless us all . 
If only did better than exhibiting TDS the whole time . 
Well these ELECTED governors will be forced by voters who are already stir crazy and want to get back to work ! ! There moral high ground wo n't work for long 
determines when the country opens . As goes so goes the country . Next . 
Just goes to show our Governor 's care more about than the president . 
The president has no clue . Is he going to provide masks and hand sanitizer for everyone 
And the Hungry and are n't going to let that go this easily . 
Thank goodness he does not hold that power ... He just wants a second wave of the virus cone November ! ! ! ! 
the of the United States of America , Tell to Go To Hell , you will decide when it is safe to tell people to go back to work and assume what use to be a normal life style , with the exception of Republican of course who are Too Scared of ! ! !

Why do most Americans feel like is pulling his strings 
I ’m in California ;  is the maybe date . I would n’t hold my breath . Perhaps June or July . 
Sehmi 
and such service s should continue pick and home delivery system with necessary protective care . 
The same governor that allowed the Lunar Year to take  in NYC ? 
will reopen pretty quick . Not all people are hiding under their beds 
He 's a nitwit , bottom line ! Envoke the th ammendment , see him unfit to serve as president ! Should n't be there in the first  ! 
said he would follow the advice of the medical committee . He did not . Make a definitive statement , so please , stop with the propaganda . Ty 
is iimpotent . He ceded his power to the states and businesses , and all his bluster will not get it back to him . 
Let ’s hope no one risk their life ’s listening to this nut case ! 
How can he reopen that which he never closed ? 
How could anyone with at least one functioning brain cell support ? Seriously ! 
Thank goodness there are people in charge , on the ground , with intelligence and the ability to listen to the data and the experts . 
. 
Yes now it does ,  weeks ago the governor was waiting for . It 's a back and forth thing 
Does it have anything to do with the toll on the Organization ? Just thinking out loud . 
Wendy 
's scary . Too many governors are already beginning to abuse their power and make rules harmful to businesses and private citizens . 
So numbers keep rising and the plan is to reopen the country so what ? Numbers can explode ? I 'm trying to understand the logic . 
That 's how America is supposed to operate . 
Silva 
Silva I 'm Democrat but I 'm getting tired of this . open may th with face mask laws . 
The lives and health of the people in your state are much more important than one man 's wish and greed to continue to be the POTUS 
And what about the " european " ban to travel to the USA ? This ends tomorrow ? 
He gave that decision away when he dumped the responsibility on the governors . 
let the governors govern . 
Go play golf , get off TV . You have nothing to offer . 
We should wait a d see if things can open . The media has already started stirring hate and division . The MSM is so easy to predict . 
It 's all about ensuring his re election . He has zero interest in how many people die . 
Hopefully they have more sense than he does . Not that it would take that much . 
doing a great job . If was President we would never recover . issues travel ban and cnn and dems call him racist . Both would love to see trump fail at the expense of the country . 
STOPPING THE TESTING ? ? ? ? ? ? 
Yes we all know the economy is 's platform for re election . He does n't care how many people die . 
The cons of electing a business man who is more concerned on how job numbers will affect his re election . I do nt blame him because he has always been consistent on the narcissist he is , i blame the people who voted for him . 
does n’t know the constitution , does not like or respect the constitution , has an adolescent view of the role of POTUS and thinks he ’s a monarch . 
Somethings should reopen like shops and other small businesses should be reopened with rules for social distances 
This ia the same governor who closed new york late and in jersey .... 
Booth 
n’t happen we are still not in a good  with this virus it do n’t take a scientist to see this 
Wow ! So at first , it was all 's fault . Now all these decisions are up to the local governments . Hmm 😕 
They have n't listened to him yet and we 're all not dead or infected with corona . 
Should n't be shut down for  days ? You are NOT an essential service by no means . 
There is and obstacle for the governors and mayors , the people , the people have always truly held the power . 
has been trying to leave the blame for everything on the states and governors since the start .

Rouse 
soon as he say open season he will threaten to take funding away for help 
If you think can make this decision .. well then do n't ask fed to help you after . 
Nice of you to come around to Federalism when it suits your story . 
Did n’t governor say this was a drill ? Maybe he knows when the drill is over ? 
Like Dr. would say , " the time line is set by the virus , not by the politicians " . 
open it up and allow each state to decide their own specific needs . Every state is different . One size does not fit all . 
You misspelled " consumers . " 
will likely be firing , he thinks the doctor is standing in his way to open the economy . 
the first does n’t understand basic civics that is taught in grade schools . 
Is anyone surprised . 
Over two thousand deaths a day and climbing . He wants to reopen . Nuts 
I 'll stay with the governors and mayors . 
claims he can override the governors ' decisions . 
YOUR GROUND DON'T GIVE IN GET TO HEAVEN WITH A GOOD AND CLEAN CONSCIENCE CAUSE WHEN NIGHT COME AND YOU TO SLEEP WITH NO PROBLEM 
As it should ! That s why we are a republic and a federation ! 
I ’ll bet dollars to donuts he does n’t take an aggressive approach to re open the House on  . 
They ’re burying people in mass graves in NYC — is this MAGA ? 
Who really cares what trump want ? The man is not capable of managing a vending machine . 
Keeping the economy closed is not in the best interest of the country ’s health , cnn . America haters 
should not give in . Lives are at stake . In the worst case scenario , will become bankrupt . 
Definitely are n’t using any overseas models , we all going to hell , st is not enough time , they need time to evaluate ; and really is up to your boss to take temperares , sure the same way the airport ’s were asking in the beginning . We going to relapse . 
Kulka maclellan 
Kulka maclellan My governor is the only one I ’m listening to , oh and my dog he ’s smarter than tRump . 
Thank god  can't ... he'd kill even more than he already has ! 
I think wants to get people back to work . 
Yes the power lies with the governors and only put out guidelines . However somehow you are blaming him for everything ? ? 
is hemorrhaging money right now so the question is moot 
From reports this is the same man who wanted to let the virus wash over the population and not worry about it . 
Dose this president listen Italy is back on the charts with the virus 💁 🏻‍ ♀ ️

Raúl D'Cotti Alicea He was also against a lack down . I 'm ready to go to work . 
So very glad that it does . We all need real men and women calling the shots cause that clown in office has no freakin ’ clue what he ’s doing . 
Then trump should withhold all the money , until the states open back up . Let 's see how long the blue states last ! ! 
HIM AND HIS FRIEND ’S STOCKS AND BUSINESSES ARE AT STAKE ! IF ANYBODY PULLS THE TRIGGER BEFORE MID LATE JUNE . WE’RE ALL DOOMED ... 
Lucky for us but not America as Texas is looking at pushing people back to work early . 
Do n't rush this good things take time do n't want a relapse . ( and this is from one person going bananas with kids at home ) 
Thank for the various levels of government in the USA 🇺 🇸 
As said it will be evaluated by region state and county 
, you mean they have the power ... , I thought it was all fault for the mess each state is in , , or so MSM would say 
By voting him out in november election.he is too incompetent to protect American ' lives . 
How are we supposed to go back to work without propper testing ? ? ? 
st would be a Doom day if this really happens . 
If our government decided not to open be prepared for a riot 
This is the worst administration led by a fool.the only thing trump does is to talk talk and talk nonesense , play gulf at 
Thank for who listen to health officials ! 
And when the economy reopens and the deaths skyrocket he will blame the governors and mayor 's 
Yes . Some of us who have paid attention to current events for more than a couple of weeks knew that . 
is happy to allow Covid to ' wash over ' America no matter the number of deaths . 
Thank goodness for checks and balances . is a disaster to our country . 
Blessed be our for a sound mind and responsible thinking ! 
Munoz 
has more care , compassion and by far common sense than President 🤦 ‍ ♀ ️ 🤦 ‍ ♀ ️ 
To all governors stay the course and protect us . just thinks of money . 
Thank for the and who follow the lead of the medical professionals ! ! 
is closed until at least / . Thank you , Governor . 
I chuckled when he said that the decision was ultimately his . 
This is the moment in time where I am thankful that my state can choose to do what ’s best for me rather than be left to the mercy of trump ’s self interests 
He better not or he 's going to get " it ! " 
So we need to pray for our country because does not care about people he cares only about Money 
Mayor 's can not supersede Governor 's orders . This is not Mexico . 
A showdown looming and if & Mayor 's yield to and anything goes tragically wrong he will lay the blame at their feet . to much of a coward to take control of pandemic . 
I hope they stand their ground until we are safe .. 
Thanks goodness that MOST governors have sense . 
Thank that the governors have more sense than  ! 
To bad he does if he did he would lock down the country but he refuses becuz it will save the economy 
wants to sacrifice you for a dollar . Remember that in November . 
I just saw with his press conference he want to open soon but safely 
Or are they keeping them closed on purpose ? 
Its better to general strike may st .. mayday  send a message to the  % 
Down . Continue to save lives and STAY HOME ! 
If the people do n’t feel safe , they will stay home . The smart ones anyway . 
Take a lesson from Zealand For gods sakes 
The power lies with the virus . 
The only thing to save us is the govenors who acted quickly 
afraid of those employment numbers . He wants everyone to get back to work sick or not . Just take some HYDRROCHLROQUINE 
Do n’t allow trump to make that decision our life depends on it 
One is on a national level the other is on a.state level . And city level and last of all os the community level 
We can trust the governors to do what 's best for their people and disregard 's desperate attempt to try to do what 's best for himself . 
A contemplating idea or thought should n't be termed a concluded decisions . 
Rosy 
! This is so good ! If this is the case , why is he even there ? 
Seriusly?with these pandemic ... they plan to re open ? 😯 
I listen to NY governor for direction and governor of Michigan ... End of discussion 
Thankfully , most governors are smarter than he . 
Should we not wait for the virus to go away ? ? ? ? 
Thank god ! Otherwise this would be a dictatorship 
Governor # thank you for your leadership 🙏 🏽

's health can not be quantified . Get over it . Fool of a took ! 
Thank the power lies with the governors ! ! ! And that our Governor is ! ! ! 
He knows he does n't have the authority to open the country . It 's just rhetoric to give the illusion he is in control . He is n't , but when the country does open up you can bet he will claim victory for doing so . He 's really worthless . 
wants us to stay on lockdown . they believe it will help Democrats in the election . 
The governor 's may have final say , but controls funding and aid . 
Hopefully the governors and mayors have a better common sense . ❤ ️ 
I thank for Governor . He is so intelligent and REALLY cares about us in his state . 
# newsome 
Mie 
Mie What a relief the governers have their say over this issue . 
I hope and pray fir for wise decision making 🙏 
need to stand firm ! ! ! ! 
Thank there are still a few good people who care about us in the Government . 
no longer has power . Leave it to the governors 
need to STICK TOGETHER for the peoples safety 
Well that 's what he wanted the states to have their own power there you go . 
Having stockpiles of supplies also falls on the governor ’s but democrats did n’t care about that . 
Thank has NO power to open the country too soon ! 
We do n’t always get what we want . 
Some of our governors are looking out for us . The rest may end up with the virus at church . 
He will just find a way to retaliate against the governors who wo n’t heed his orders ! POS ! 
Thank goodness for intelligent and ! 
Thank for the governors and mayors , if you are not in Florida . 
and thank you for protecting us . 
has been a plague on America and the world since the day he took office ! 
Thank for states ' rights . 
to the medical professionals . Do n't listen to the orange guy . 
Thank for our smart , caring and Mayors. 🙏 🏻 
Of course the malicious of is more than obvious in this hateful propaganda 
for the Governor 's he does n't have common sense ! ! 
Governor will do the right thing . 
That 's right keep us safe ! ! 
but if the power is with governors why are you blaming that he did n't lockdown the country ? ? ? 
US is so confused 😂 😂 😂 
thing the governor 's are there to check 's actions 
Thank for who care about people over money . 
to the experts ! Thank goodness most of the governor 's do ! 
Keep us closed up til June to fight it off at least 
Some states have n't even closed because of trump . 
I wonder what would happen if the people decide to go back to work ? 
People just need to be safe and clean . We ca n't be out of work much longer . 
This is going to be a fawkin disaster as long as he continues to be president 
Thank for governors who will do the right thing , here in Colorado anyway 
I really wish Mr. would run for President 🙏 
Major 
strong ... NOT go BACKWARD just for $ $ $ We need to be safe ... M.J. 
it is a tough call for presidents .. a lot tougher than we like to chit chat 
to the medical experts mayors and governors , not to ! ! 
Yeah .... governors gon na have none of that . 
It 's up to the governors to protect us because god knows trump wo n't 
Thank for ! ! At least in NY , CA , OR , MI & WA at least that I can think off ! 
Hopefully there is more out there 🙏 🏼 
Thank you and ! 
I got bad news WE THE PEOPLE will open it up ! 
His hotel business is suffering . 😭 
My leadership is my Governor of California ❤ ️ 🇺 🇸 because he is taking care of us just fine . I do n’t know what thinks he is going to accomplish by telling America to go back to normal in 🤦 🏻‍ ♀ ️oh yeah he wants votes 🤦 🏻‍ ♀ ️ 💔 🇺 🇸 
Thank goodness the governors have brains .. 
thank goodness that the power comes from governors 
Folks listen to your governors and mayors . They care about your health . 
Thank goodness for the and . 
I look to our Governor for guidance . Ca n’t trust the House . 
Thank goodness the have the ‘ say ’ on this one ! 
strong Govs . you care more for your people than does . 
If we take all the steps . We can reopen the country by  . 
He will have another council of yes men for sure . Not happening trump .

Go ! You SHOULD be in charge . 
does not have that power and good luck dealing with Gov. and Gov. . 
Initially , was wrong , was wrong , was wrong , yeah , yeah , yeah . That was then , this is now . 
: Save Lives . Get it together and get the job done ! ! 
Strong governors . Do n't bow down to this money hungry heartless soul . 
Glad the governors are standing their ground . 
and mayors get the job done . 
! ! I smell civil war soon 
will leavce those deicions up to the governors . Every state is different ... 
Do n’t listen to . Without nationwide testing we can not . Save yourself . Stay home ! Do n’t die for . 
Hermogino 
n’t listen to , he is n’t the stable genius he thinks he is . Do as you will 
Thank for that at least in some states . 
So admits that the local governors and mayors actually make the call after weeks of saying otherwise . 
The are way more on the ball than ! ! 
has to Rule 
I trust every word that Governor say is a wicked man 
did n't close the country , he left it up to governors and mayors . Serious lack of leadership . 🤷 ‍ ♂ ️ 
, please just ignore him . Carry on . 
All he cares about is himself and his ratings 
K 
K It is s good sign of federalism 
I just wish he ’d shut up and go away ! ! 
Its to soon ! 
I will listen to my Governor of Massachusetts over any day . 
Hopefully they ignore him , like most sane Americans . 
Your life or his election , think about it , I ’m sure he has . 
your governors and the doctor . 
Davoudi 
governors do n’t listen to him , use your judgment 
Thank for the who have some brains ! 
on to your powers governors do n't let him screw us again 
Yes ! Reopen the country ! Let it sink ! 😢 
Hopefully they are smart governors like and Inslee . 
If the USA wants to save lives please ignore and listen to medical experts . 
He already announced he would override the governors 
is irrelevant noise . The are the decision makers 
Thank . If everything was in trump power , he would kill millions . 
Thank that power is not in the hands of the president . 
Maas 
of our hospitals do n't have enough PPE and talks about opening up the country .. 
Because everyone wants to blame trump for this not state leaders . 
are our only hope against the cheeto emperor ... 
Hopefully trump will restore what he can . Let the governors deal with their states . 
" power really lies with governors , " but let 's blame .... 
I am praying for some type of intervention for the man who thinks that he alone can solve all the problems ! 
Everyone who goes back to work has to be tested first . 
Stansell 
, enough if the bad photos of the Democrats . You can do better than this . 
If know your direction , plan your fate to suit your purpose . Those at the apex know it all . 
Thank we are not a Blue State ! ! ! Enjoy the socialism you all ! 
Whoever wants to stay home , no problem you can stay home . Let other people enjoy their life and freedom 
I ’m not going to listen to trump he does n’t care if he kills us . He is worried about the money . 
All cares about is the stock market 
The mayor has done what was to have done but trump has n't done what was to have done 
must not want Americans to be successful and have their jobs back . 
Now he is going to blame the economy on the governors . 
It does n't in may the ussa bankrupt 
Him and his family should go first .. say NYC .. Florida then Seattle take Duh with you 
Do n’t let him do it he ’s a killer all he care is himself . Lock him up 
’s who will vote for you if we die . You only have a job because of the people . 
is gona be convicted of crimes against humanity at this rate . 😑 
Ca n't keep the country closed until arrives . 
Sorry , but life needs to go on . 
Somebody have to be smart and adult . Please stop him . 
up for America , do what is right for our people . 
If trump opens the country and the governors do n’t it ’s on them that people are out of work 
wants to open up Florida so that ppl will go to his golf course and hotel there . 
the Governor ’s all they want is the money trail 
He cares for nothing , but money , GOD wo n't allow him to harm this country . 
How true why does he just disappear Mr . . 
Victor A 
Victor A We ’re not ready yet 
Thank it 's out of his jurisdiction . 🤗 
He is such an ignoramos 
Can report on the fires in Chernobyl 
is only concerned about the money , not the people . 
I am not listening to a man that thinks , people dying is a good job . 
I think we needed to stay shut down till September I am afade to go out 
Easy solution open the border that will force governor 's hands . 
trump did n’t close anything and ca n’t re open anything . He ’s pretty useless at everything . 
leave it up to President .... ooops I mean ... 
My hat off to and 
Every life matters . Please everyone stay home and stay safe . 
He forgot .... he 's just the back up . 
What is worrying more is the economy . What he does nt know Life is irreable . 
stand your ground . Do n't let bully push you to put profits above public health . 
Another way to put this , trump tries to maximize deaths . 
wants just the opposite of whatever President says or wants . I ’m surprised they ’re still in business , as they ’re Not Essential ! 
I ’m sure red state will open  . 
Governor and mayors please plan the best for us 
Not his decision . 
I agree with . Open up everything NOW . We have to get to work 
To hell with trump and his crew 🖕 🖕 🖕 
and and other scientific experts will tell us when it 's safe . 
President and his investments are for more important than peoples well being . 🖕 🏽 and his government 
The only way they think they can beat is to have the economy fail ! ! ! ! ! ! 
thank god it 's not up to dumpster 
Governor 's and Mayor 's do n't . You set the tone and look out for the United States .. 
ole GOP rallying cry " State 's rights " 
Now take it in your backside ! ! 😂 😂 
So everyone has to drag themselves to work even tho they are sick ! 
It ’s about time , intelligent people , will 
Decide , not his people , or rally goers . 
says he can over ride what the governors decide . 
Dody 
that someone else who has more sense will do what s best . 
HAS NO PRESIDENT 
to State leaders and ignore the Orange Fool . 
Why ca n't they lock him up 
our governors will use common sense 
Let anyone walk through the WH then ! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 🎉 😀 🎉 
No really , the president has more power , lol 
His brain is limited he wo n’t understand 
THE DRS THE SCIENTISTS , NOT A GUY WITH A GUT FEELING , ESPECIALLY trumps GUT ! 
He is trying to kill us all 
Sue 
I hope he does n't do it . That 's too soon ! 
Maybe it ’s time for him to THINK and use his brain . 🤷 🏻‍ ♀ ️ He does not know how to lead , obviously ! 
Leslie 
a healthy population comes a healthy economy . 
He , people , he does n't know yet,,stop listening to , CNn 
just using this as an excuse to blame the mayors for the economy 
Thank goodness the power lies with the governors . 
That is not good if it is to soon ! ! ! 
Putting money over lives , no surprise . 
Do the right thing not the easy thing ! ! ! Stay closed . 
Glad it ’s not ’s call . 
Does anyone still listen to this man ? ? ? ? ? 
Stay safe America 🙏 From Australia 🇦 🇺 
It ’s time to ignore the fool , and do what is best for the people 
So much for a pro life party .... Hahaha what a joke 
Exactly . Tell governor of Texas that .. 
Seriously ? ? was NOT aggressive enough at all ! ! 
We want to safe ours life ’s ! We want to feel safe ! ! I do n’t go to work even the  for who I work open ! 
For all you whiners on here , get ready to cry more November . 
He 'll probably put on a HISSY FIT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
Welp get ready for a nd wave of coronavirus ..

First ray of hope ! 
Let me guess , the only thing standing in 's way , is the Democrats 
The governors ' powers are subordinate to the president 's 
Great ! Georgia is doomed ! 
The power lies with WE THE PEOPLE ! 
Smooth hey I told them . But they did n't listen .

Thank or he would end up killing us all 
The 🤡 is going to get more people killed 
Cue : sigh of relief ! 
Not the Great and Powerful Orange Clown he thinks he is after all ! ! ! 
Sanctuary cities are the hardest hit . I wonder why ? Build that wall ! ! ! 
wants to kill us all and stay alone , that is exactly what he wants .. i was in doubt , now i 'm sure ! ! The man is really crazy 
I trust them so much more than I would ever Stump ... 
By  ... that ’s not gon na happen ! 😂 
Sick / dead people ca n't work . Dead people ca n't buy things . It 's that simple . 
trump is fast realizing he is not all powerful . He is not a as he and his supporters want . 
never d any restrictions . Therefore he ca n’t re open anything 😂 
We do not need to reopen the country until we have enough testing to be given to the general public so we all know for sure whether we have it or not . 
We ca n’t rush this unless you want this to take more lives over a longer period of time . … mult 
Sydney

Key word aims not is reopening 🙄 🙄

Hey are you kidding me ? What kind of question is that ? 
No it 's to early yet 
Enough is enough open up the city 
.I am counting on Governnor . 
Is he crazy ? 
Ca n't wait until November . 
What to do , what to do ? 😶 
See all the cry baby 's are out 
’s brother has no idea what he ’s doing 
They are supposed to . 
Humanity should be in the center . 
th is the day ! 
way too soon ... what 's up with him 
If you rush this ..... China wins 
No .. it is too soon 
What ever he 's still the president .... 
Got to be Nice to Me . 😶 
Get the popcorn . 
I 'm ready to get back to normal . 
to open up . YES 
It 's best we safe lives first before economy 
as how the lockdowns violates freedom of association and freedom of movement , a case could be made for to have pursue legal actions against every state governor and mayor who has imposed a lockdown . That he has not done so shows how little he really cares . 
I urge the governors to do what is right for their citizens . Thank the governors and have the power if not would have dictate what he feel is best for him . 
Dahrin 
had even been a mediocre leader , issuing a nationwide stay in  RECOMMENDATION , not even an order , would have given him more leverage now to reopen the economy . That he did n’t further illustrates how inept he truly is . 
can holler “ go back to work ” , all he wants , but This American is going to listen to the experts . ’s lack of knowledge has caused the death of s of Americans . 
Who ’s ready for government distancing .... when can we take Our Country back ? ... my business is essential ... I own it and I ’m ready to work and get my livelihood back ! 
already said even if he opened the country up it would be up to governors to make final decisions . It was in one of the last news conferences he had . So nice try to spin it . Worthless media source . 
If he wants the country to open , needs to go on the front lines and work to help save all COViD victims . 
now that the USA leads the world in virus deaths .. is not the time to even consider lifting tough measures .. without a vaccine ready and administered to everyone .. no good will come from it 
Our fearless plutocrat overlords though just want to get back to business as usual no matter how many of us die in the process . They ’ll never agree to universal healthcare , living wages , corporate accountability , etc . 
No one should show up at 's press release , just block him out and let the Governor 's and head doctors do their job . 
If people ca n’t work and lose their homes , where will they live ? Grocery shelves are empty . If you want to stay in or quit your job and stay in , do so . Some of us have to work and a one time government payment wo n’t do much when bills are behind . This … mult 
The curve seems to be flattening as hoped with our isolation . We have done a good job ! Opening back up too soon will only cause a second wave , and then we will have to start over . I hope our leadership listens to the experts .

All in his selfish desire to be re elected . does not care how many people die ... as long as he is still the President . he will not get re elected with the markets tanking and record unemployment . 
Until we have a vaccine or at least a medicine to slow it down there will be many more people dying if the economy opens up as normal . 
The governors should make the call for their own state . Just like they had to order their own supplies . has no plan . He 's just shooting from the hip . He has no idea of what he 's doing . 
Of course he does . It 's more important his economy comes back due to him hoping to be re elected on that than people staying safe and not having to die ! 
There s not even a vaccine yet and he wants to open up the country wow nothing but money over lives on that president trump heart lives do nt matter to him never have seems like that to me has n't this super genius come up with a vaccine yet since he him self said he understands it so much and doctors were amazed like he should step aside and let the doctor 's and experts handle it simple as that

I am grateful that our governor has Mexicans best interests at heart . Thank goodness for our governors ! 
That s right  , no one is listening to you anymore . You are trying to take us all down . We will trust people who know what they are doing , and who care for us ! 
Curtis 
refused to take the responsibility for shutting down the states , leaving it to the . Now he wants to reopen and he does n't have that ability because , well the state 's .... 
I bet this plays out ... say no , keep the stay at home order and says business as usual . Those who defy him will be threatened with having federal dollars with held . I would put money on it this happens as it has so many time before this . is garbage ! 
And I am thankful the governors hold the power . Lord knows the idiots in Washington are too busy lining their pockets to help citizens . 
Vote the whole lot out . 
, how can you not see your bias ! You have continually blamed for not shutting things down . Now that he 's hoping for things to open you are criticizing him that he does n't have that power . 
It 's correct he does n't have the power so why have you blamed him for not closing things sooner ? 
The first US case was confirmed on January st , while the WHO was still downplaying the whole thing ! closed down travel from China  days later and got slammed for it by the Fake News and the Democrats ! Monday morning quarter backing is easy after you know the game outcome ! 
We view more as a president than anyway 
The economy is public health . 
Human lives are more important that money . But as long as it does n't effect ' Chump 's ' bottom line , he could care less . He has not one fiber of humility coursing through his body . He needs to be humbled from a higher source . 
Your governor of , governor should run for president He has a soul and a heart for the people under his protection . From the outside looking in , he has tried so hard to get what he needs for the people of NY . 🇦 🇺 🇦 🇺 
Wait will back peddle under pressure . He has no idea what the heck he 's doing . He 's listening to and his cronies .. Just trying to look good for reelection . He 's still downplaying this pandemic . Still attacking americans . pathetic 
Jesperson

If people just thought for themselves n stopped relying on what the government says ( whoa , what a concept ) then you will probably be better off .. meaning , if you do nt feel safe to go out , then stay home . If you feel safe then go out .. use your own best judgement given what you already know ... stop relying on government for everything ! Do what 's best for you as an individual

Really , then why are they blaming for their states Chinese outbreak ? Ca nt have it both ways now ! 
failed NY ... simple as that .... Left wing media wants to blame for his incompetence . 
Thank god for the governors . The ones listening to the experts and caring more for life than money ! 
What they ’re trying to say is that the Democrats feel they have the power the Democratic governors to screw the people for their agenda . Remember the Democrats do not work for the American people obviously they fought the president on everything he does even though he ’s done a way better job than could even dream in his where his dreams . But Americans do n’t care what the governors think we care what ’s right and economy needs to get going and the Democratic governors want to stall it to ruin trumps economy just to screw the American people . But we the American people realize how evil and corrupt the fake news in the Liberal party has become and that ’s why so many of us stand with President 
I ’ll follow the lead of who managed to flatten the CA curve . Not the man who puts profits over people and treats Covid updates like political rallies . 
Democratic governors and mayors all across the country are increasingly over stepping their authority under the guise of " public health / safety " and are being enabled by local law enforcement . If this continues it will lead to someone getting hurt or worse killed . Someone needs to step in and put a stop to this power grab or it will happen ! 
He has n’t shown any true leadership from the beginning , claiming it was up to the , so why should anyone listen to him now ? He is just concerned with the coming election !

Since the state has the power to stop the federal govt from reopening the economy so should they be blame for all this death in there state . They should be held responsible for the death not the federal authority . 
's incompetence and inaction has pretty much rendered him irrelevant in this . 
Between life and death vs money , Republicans choose money at all cost . Party of pro life ? Yeah right . 
He could care less about all the thousands of Americans who will still be expose to whoever still is carrying the virus . I , myself would be one of them , I am  and have asthma . He could care less , he is sitting up in a safe  , the WH .

one should have closed down schools until the end of the year . Now that we will be opening back up and all these schools closed down hastily , it just made more of a mess for parents going back to work . to go . Glad our school always planned on going back and continued to make prom and graduation plans . 
Not really paying much attention to the president since I got my vertigo diagnosed ! Too much SMH ! 
Oh so now the power lies in the , but when the complain the President did n’t shut down the state that ’s the President ’s fault . How convenient for the . 😒 News flash , the power always laid with the ... for good or bad . 
. Ohio Gov. ( ) this is from Political , lets follow his lead . 
Perhaps no single governor has done more to put the nation on a war footing in the fight against coronavirus than , whose actions have contributed to Ohio ’s relatively modest number of cases , with a per capita infection rate currently ranked th out of  states . 
At  , this is the first time in my life that people realize that each state has it 's own power and the federal government only has the power to back them up . They used to teach this in schools , but some how got pushed to the back burner over time . 
Sad it takes something like this virus to make each state realize this . 
Well now it ’s been said and the dems had their say as well as the media you played right into his hand bozos cause now you ca n’t blame the economy on is all you and your democratic mayors/ . is a freaking master at getting you guys to shine the light on yourselves . 😂 
We have really given these governors far too much power in my opinion ; they ’re completely drunk with it . However , when the feds stop giving them money to fund their states because their sales tax revenue is non existent , let ’s see how it goes . 
I just heard a doctor say to wait until the end of or we will have wasted what we have done so far . 
Actually , he 's surrounded by his terrible medical staff who do not want people to leave their homes or go back to normal life unless they get vaccinated or chipped / medical I d cards ! ! I 'm looking at you , and the rest of your medical cronies surrounding Mr. , we now know you work for ! ! 
Nobody should pay attention to anything that Scump the Terrible says . He ’s the harbinger of death and destruction . He ’s single handedly trying to make Revelations in the Bible come true . 
is really a joke . Was n't a week ago they were wondering why the federal government had n't issued a national stay at home order . Now the power lies with the states . 
and listen to the and of the USA who manage and are working on the front lines of this Pandemic . 
aims to have a positive hopeful outlook during a time of despair . Any other president would be praised for his faith during a time of crisis . But not this president . Not with this media . This media needed this pandemic . This media needs to fail at the cost of all of us . 
Late to respond to this pandemic , now wants to rush the recovery . 
Let him open up the WH for business . The rest of us will listen to the science and practice good discipline in our roll out of the economy. … mult 
The governors have saved a lot of lives on his own would have crashed the healthcare system 
Actually , the power is with the people , who will only endure so much government overreaching before they give mayors and governors who abuse their power a lesson on why the constitution gives citizens a right to bear arms as protection against such government tyranny . 
is counting on " opening the country back up " and the governors not following his lead so he can use it politically .

Whaaat is wrong with this man . The numbers are climbing people are dying . There is NO cure , NO vaccine ! If  person can infect ppl the those can infect each omg ... does n't he realize the cycle will never end ! In my opinion shut down the whole country for weeks period . Except for essentials ... this virus is horrid ! And the idea of opening up the country by st is wven more HORRID ! 
Thank for the governors . Most have done a great job . trump is useless so they took charge and got the job done . 
Leslie 
Leslie So.e s are ahead of others as far as seeing the curve and peak of cases . Each state is different with different requirements for opening schools and businesses . Plus , most people have no antibodies nor is there a vaccine . I would be reluctant schools until we jhave a vaccine or preventative treatment . 
trump said it was n't he responsibility , so the took control over their states . trump has no business mandating any control over any of these states . He stepped away from his responsibility . So shut up trump and let Melania take care of you . 
has said many times that the state governments need to run their own states . The federal government is n’t there to carry them . So governors , listen to the medical community .  is  weeks away and this wo n’t be over by then . just wants his businesses open . 
Paris 
Paris wants to sacrifice more lives on the altar of the stock market . 
Do n’t let him kill thousands more . 
So if they hold the power to reopen , did n’t they also hold the power to close ? Why does blame the President for not closing things down earlier when it ’s the Governers who are to blame ? 
Nonthaveth 
the country for right now it 's very dangerous to every American people.these viruses could little bit longer . 
That ’s correct it is indeed up to the . We are a Republic . So now gets it . It was also up to each and every Governor to set the plan in  for their states to handle the virus . The President is there to assist them . That ’s the way our Government works . So stop blaming ! 
Yes , keep on doing your own thing , because , et.al .. don't have a clue what they are doing , and they are really doing Nothing ... 
This a ploy by the man child , he wants to say to American 's i wanted to open up the country for business , but the Governor 's ( probably Dems will be mentioned ) refused . 
So blame your Governor 's not me .

Averi ca n’t have it both ways . He refused to call for a national stay at home policy so he has no authority to open things back up . He only wants to use his power when it ’s to his advantage . He does n’t give a about us ! 
I 'm sure that all of these will be more than willing to take the credit for the loss of jobs when they continue to keep their economies " shut down " , even if coronavirus deaths have decreased to a minimal number . 
and mayors who value people ’s lives , please stand still . There are many conspiracy theories behind his plot . By re opening this vulnerable country , more people are going to get sick through November ’s elections . He will declare No Elections and he will be automatically re elected . Dear governors and mayors , be strong and do n’t give up nor give in . 
That will be news to him that the federal government has , in your constitution , written limited powers and that the states have no such limit ..... 
We , Yorkers , are confident that Gov. , unlike orange man , will do the right thing for humanity . He will listen to scientists , doctors ............. and never put money before human lives .

The number of confirmed Covid  cases in the U.S. is still too high for them to go back to their normal routines and lift the lockdown . Doing so could wipe out the entire U.S. population . Covid multiplies exponentially . No one is larger than life when it comes to this . Take risks to live or to die . You can also die a hero if you want . Everybody 's got a choice .

Thank I live in NewYork with a Governor who has a brain and wo n't open until it is as safe as possible . The red states will see a lot more death . No one is going to save them but themselves by not listening to the idiot president . 
trump needs to sit down and hush , OR get out and visit some hospitals to see what people and the medical staffs are going thru . Let him catch the virus and experience it . I do n't want him to die ... I want him to suffer thru it so maybe , I doubt it though , might understand the full scope of this virus ! ! ! Right now there is nothing between those ears that has one blooming clue ! ! ! 
Something went right , — me , me , it was me and only me . Something went wrong—wasn’t me , I do n’t know those people , it was all their fault ! 
can reopen the country but the success will come if the people of this country look for jobs that have been lost , and the consumer wanting to go out . will be long gone by the time any lawsuits against these companies will be settled or taken to court . 
Funny that get there information from a and his task force . Most have done what he asked them to do . however , did not when he first asked them to do a stay at home . even went to China town and said everyone should celebrate and not be scared . So who is really trying to protect Americans health . Not all governors . Not Congress . 
The power is with the and they like the power they have over the citzens seizing and closing businesses having their own army to enforce their wishes nope not going to let open up plus most are Democrat and want the economy in shambles to win in November

Houston needs to Shut up , sit down and keep his mouth closed . This is the way it is wether you like it or not . The Doctor 's and Nurses , and Medical staff will tell us when it 's SAFE to open up the country . WTF are you a Doctor now ? 
How will they would enforce this ? Not let ppl cross from state to state and when the " safer " states start catching the virus again and have to start all over with quarantine . How will that affect our economy ? ? ! This just seems illogical to me . We are the UNITED states of America ! finish this together ! 
Open the WH to unmasked , ungloved American citizens . Let 's see how he then reacts to " reopening the ] country soon " . Ask Melania how safe she and her son will be when the present POTUS puts his interests ahead of the citizens of the U.S. , and the rest of the world . November is the time to end this madness , VOTE ! 
fake news . The headline would suggest that trump thinks he has total say so in when to restart the country . Remember He is the one that was crucified by the media for not sending the fed stockpile to the states and HE was the one that said the states are responsible . And the media hit him on that when he said it . Fake news at it again . 
can want all he wants . I am sure that people who believe their work environment is not safe , will not and can not be forced to return to work until such time the needed remedies are in  . He can go suck an egg . 
Democratic attempting to drive the economy into the ground by prolonging a shutdown in their respective states for political gain will only face harsh criticism and backlash from their own citizens after other open up their states and thrive . They ’ll bask in their own misery . 
Those all need to be included in a collective campaign video to expose for his lies and greediness . All cares about is the money , NOT people !

please do n't force the president to declare law and send in The military to enforce it . They need to work together 
And and his task force actually have said this how many times ? He can not close the states down and he can not open them back up . He does not have that kind of power . All he can do is set up a task for the recommend the best case of action . 
And 's statement and desire to open economy early and not listen to the medical community , should ensure you get millions for your civil lawsuit ! File after he leaves office and you could be on for compensation for his acts . A death of a loved one or permanently affected individual , because of 's inaction and false claims ! Remember , you could be rewarded millions ! 
If this country opens up too soon , we will be back to square one . , This man is has done an excellent job . Any businessman always hires the best people to the job . This virus is not something to blow off . It may keep returning and mutating a long time . 
We are never going back to what we thought is the norm . You people need to realize what is happening . 
said it was State responsibly to get supplies and mandate their residents , right ? Well , same goes to reopen 
Honey 
please ... that ’s what has been saying . We ’ve been listening . And we the people have heard it directly from him . He ’s been up front first and foremost about the states making the decisions on behalf of the public safety . Ridiculous post . You got nothing but an agenda to disregard what he ’s actually saying and doing to fill your negative narrative . What a load . 
made it clear that the States were responsible for their response . He can not now turn around and open all States without their OK . He can not have it both ways . 
I feel sorry for you all ... what a wrong decision , i understand that everbody needs his job and money , but your health , you only have one is very important , Stay home Stay safe 🙏 🙏 🙏 in Holland we have strict rules until  June 
Problem here is our Governor takes his medical and political advice from which means a lot of people are going die and the economy is going to crash anyway 
If you are at home , not working , and under any kind of shelter in  orders , it is because of your governor or employer , not the president . Of course federal employees are under the direction of the executive branch . The federal government can issue guidelines but it is the governors that have the power . The executive branch can do things like stop international travel , but not much more . 
wants to reopen because of the stimulus money he and his cronies have received . It 's a repayable loan until they retain or rehire their employees , then it becomes forgivable , therefore , making it free money .

He wo n’t open the economy . The doctor in charge has said many times that trump listens to him and takes all he says very seriously . Anyway the governor and mayor of who are Democrats were n’t that serious when it came to shutting down since it took them down till there were , infections before shutting down and they had vowed that they would n’t shut down no matter what . The mayor of Orleans let Mardi Gras go on and many of the infections came from that celebration and that was deep into the outbreak and he is also a Democrat and the same goes on for many other cities 
Hopefully the will do the right thing since probably wo n’t . It ’s a bad situation but the country needs to be shutdown until this virus is contained no matter how long it takes . 
I hope that decision is left up to mayors and governors , not him , he did n’t see it coming , why does he think this is just going to disappear ? It ’s not leaving any time soon , my opinion only ! At least I knew it was coming ! ! 
English 
need healthcare assurances before the economy , we are not ruled by the stock market . I say close it down , no trading ! Maybe then will care about healthcare !

The governors who are Democrats will probably keep their economies shut down until the election . The economies in those states will probably be completely destroyed , but at least people will be safe from the Coronavirus ! 
There 's really no opening back up until the CDC declares this virus contained . Stop ing profit over people ! 
As I 've said all along DON'T DO WHAT SAYS .

So please do n’t blame on the late reaction : ) The and County officials were the ones to decide ! 
Glad you finally got the clue ! I told you guy 's this last week ! The Administration reduced that Presidential Authority and gave it to the CDC , Governor 's and Mayor 's . 
He surrendered his power for national shut down and said “ ill leave it up to state and local officials . ” Sorry , you ca n’t take it back . Of course my nation state will receive orders from my governor . We are n’t listening to anyone who is n’t concerned about public health . 
He ’s been saying those exact words since the beginning of March ... 
Scary when you governor is from Florida . He impressed me a lot at first , but he ’s proven to be a Trumpeteer 
Jacque 
my thought ! left everything to the ! Did n't enforce stay at home for ANY states . And yet he 's going to decide when to open them up ? ? 
People can take care of themselves and their health . This is n't a communist country where governors say everything citizens must do . Anyway coronavirus will not go away soon . People need to work ! 
This has been the a premise from the start .. did just twist things ... again ? Wanting and hoping we can does n't mean it WILL happen people . 
America who on earth came up with all these laws ? No wonder even a pandemic seams to split that country down the middle based on belief when facts are on your dinner plate 🤯 
Any bets he will deny saying that to when the time is right ! 
I ’ll believe any man who fearlessly looks directly at a solar eclipse without eye protection ! 🙄 
I like how he is already setting up fake scapegoats for a decision he will end up making . on my bad , he wo n't take any responsibility . 
A 
A will not get his way on this . The numbers wo n't be in his favor and opening all at once would be a disaster 
True ... the and local authorities have the final say so ... just like they had responsibility to have their States and Communities prepared for any type of Emergency or Catastrophe ! ! ! We are not Socialist or Communist ... the Executive branch is only one part of Government people ! 
This does n't do anything to help the pubic perception of as an avariced bottomfeeder more concerned with money than human life . 
palmer 
palmer Well as soon as I see little hands out in crowds , golfing , hugging , kissing and shaking hands with all . I will think about going out . However pretty sure I will be safe at home . 
EIGHT states led by Republican governors have not put any real stay at home orders in  . Do they think th virus will respect state boundary lines ? 
I always wonder what he was talking about he did n’t shut anything done and he is unable to open anything remember he said this state approach right 
That s right , governors will have the final say in each state , but the people / voters will have the final say in November . If the people think the governor is shut down for politics , in the next election !

is what the should do . To all his pals who want him to open the economy . Each and everyone them , who will hid in their mansions and rake in the profits from these bad decisions , should meet and shake hands with all the workers who come to work because want to but because they have to . 
Come on , Governor .... RUN FOR PRESIDENT ! ! ! We need someone who will be decisive , a leader .... and will plan and organize the best path for our country . Please run for our President .... ! ! ! ! ! 
..... just like the issues states have is the fault of said governors as opposed to ... Ca n’t have it both ways ... 
There is going to a large battle between the democrats and Republicans on getting their person elected President . The only problem with that is the democrats have no ammo . 
Haha yes everyone should know this ! And also when complaining about trump not acting or having enough supplies remember that also is controlled by the state and its government . So when all the s its was real bad all happen to be democrat run states it 's no surprise 
is being pressured by the oligarchs and corporations to get things open so they can recoup what they lost in the stock market crash . They are calling him and to try and push their ' Profits before People ' agenda . 
Oh , so it is all on the States to get through the pandemic on their own . Oh , wait I need my numbers to go up , the economy all I inherited . Can I wish wash about and now say I do have the authority to make decisions??Wait if I do anything , I will have to take responsibility . , just kidding 
I can blame it on anyone else but myself . Haha , = tatertot . 
Democrat governors will resist for political expediency at the doom of their citizens . They will make political gain more important than the well being of their citizens 
As soon as he delivers the tests & PPE & ventilators . 
can not have it both ways . He did not want responsibility and left it to the states and the mayors , who retain the power to leave in effect or remove stay at home orders . Now he has to live with that . I would suggest rather than focus on the economy he focus on the public health and healthcare aspects . Businesses can not function without healthy employees . Prime example , today a national meat processing company announced it is closing down operations due to the virus . While I was dismayed with the first quarter report from my retirement fund , I still am not ready to die just so can get the economy up for his billionaire friends . 
Not gon na happen Doofus ! If you would have acted a month earlier we would n’t be in this predicament right now ! It ’s because of YOU that it ’s gotten out of control ! Not blaming you for the virus , blaming you for how you ’ve handled things ! PISS poorly ! We will Remember on the rd of November ! You ’re FIRED ! ! 💙 
Another major obstacle .. covid . No one can predict what this country will loom like by May. It has n't peaked all across the country yet 
It was a mistake to shut it down to begin with . The virus is not anywhere near bad enough to warrant it 
States will listen to Orange ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
has made America so great and strong that it ca n't handle a shut down without melting down ? 
Glad governors are staying strong . , dead so far , just imagine just saying that ’s good back to work and another  come quick . Testing is key but feds decided they wo n’t bother 
" lies with the , " but all the responsibility lies with the President ? That 's not how this works . 
A few days ago was asking why the President did n't order a national lockdown and now they are saying that the President does n't have the authority to open up from lockdown . 
The other day he said it 's up to the governors , but he can make them do whatever he wants . That 's not how state sovereignty works . 
So you are finally admitting that are responsible for the Virus response ? 
June 
in Florida unfortunately we have a toady . Hopefully he will do the right thing and not open until it is prudent to do so . 
Responsibility lies with the State to find the money and resources to care for their residents , but it ’s ’s power and his power alone to reopen those states ... 🙄 does not compute 
No to the governors why did you give them power for ohio will never open because of ours 
The people can overcome any dictator of a Governor with the President 's permission ! 
That statement “ But the power really lies with governors ” says a lot ! Especially when it ’s is trying to pin the whole Corona virus outbreak on ! Hypocrisy at its best ! 
The decision should be up to the doctors . Period . does not care if we live or die .... only money . 
We still have n't started to shut down the country . Yea we are at stay at home order . But no one is enforcing that . Smh 
The longer this goes , the more people are going to starve . Everybody needs to stop thinking about Corporations and start thinking about the little people . We . Need . To . Work . 
, new cases everyday and close to  deaths a day . Well done . 
Half of all US cases and deaths occur in and Jersey . job taking control Democrats . 
and now he 's going to fire fauci because he hurt his feelings by speaking the truth . PLEASE VOTE BLUE AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT , BECAUSE IT DOES . 
min 
I 'm glad he 's going to reopen the country by first which one of his pockets is he taking it out of ? 
Not to be hurry economic back opening to be on time pandemic coronavirus not yet gone to be the vaccine first ! 
So the , who were supposed to prepare for something like this , did not and blamed the Feds , but now want to take charge again ? 
That 's correct there governors have control over their state . So why all the blame on trump for not shutting down earlier ? 
If the Governor of wants to keep his State locked down then he needs to find where to get the money from for his economy and not the rest of the world . He is asking for $  Billion and he needs to find it in his State and not from other States . 
Where were these so called powers to protect us when they kept saying trump is n't doing anything ? These powers only acted on to defy trump ? Or protect the ppl ? 
If they have all this power should n't we be blaming them instead of trump , after all they are the representatives of our states ? 
Ok , it 's up to the governors , according to . IF Texas opens up and doing good , we do n't want all you other states coming here to Texas . We can handle it . 
I just looked at the figures and I 'm devastated for you all , the death rate is beyond belief . Stay Strong and know that countries like Australia are sending you the LOVE . 
So which one is it . It ’s fault because he did n’t act soon enough or The states hold the power ? The states ca n’t hold the power to reopen but not be responsible for not closing soon enough 🤷 ‍ ♂ ️

trump to send his family out here in the streets for  days first without protection like us and then we can talk about it later .

Someone at the most trusted name in news must have done research on constitutional authority . The last several week you were questioning why the federal government did n't issue a national order . 
is gearing up to lay the guidance for a phased re opening soon . As long as strategic and responsible , I am all for it . 
it 's understandable of course he does . but we 're not even on the recovery side of this yet . each day worse than the next :( 
He did n't want to ask the last  states to " close down " he has no say in opening this back up . 
Now thinks he can control the virus ! I hope governors are smart enough to go by the experts ! 
Yes we are seeing how the demoncrapt governor of is handling the situation that have killed many in his state .

Are you sure ? You all said two weeks ago had the power to issue a Nation Wide Lockdown ... but now he does n't have the power to reopen the economy ... sound like he only has the power to do whatever you all want him to do ... 🤦 🏻‍ ♂ ️ 
LOL ! ! closed half of NY , then  % then moved to only essential workers . He caused a lot of NY lives . was the least prepared governor in the union ... SMH ! ! 
maybe they wanted to trust the big guy aka who was shouting high and low that this was nothinf to worry about .... It is always easy to critisize 
Now hmmm . was blamed for the lack of response but have the power to do stay at home orders . could had done stay at home orders before any CDC guidelines came out as they have their own medical professionals . for instance … mult 
What ’s the rush ? ? , people just died in one day In NYC , I seriously do n’t think we ’re going to wake up and all of this is going to be over in two weeks . Let ’s just wait to see a decline in deaths and new cases and go from there . is a weirdo wtf 
We will see which of the GOP are in his hip pocket & on their knees to him as this goes forward . Who got pork from the stimulus will also be evident . see if continues to act irresponsible with him residing in Fla & with Mar … mult 
When you crying Democrats come saying your bills are wanting money and you out of food , remember trump wanted you to go back to work before this happens 
If the governor does not go along with trump they receive No federal help . This is part of the vindictiveness that trump has brought to our government and America . I can go back to and no president has done anything like this before . 
McDougall 
do n't always get what we want , I did n't want him to be president , how about you ? ? ? 
Out in a densely populated environ , now , & hope for enlightenment . 
Probably not forthcoming , given his ignorance . 
Pammii 
Pammii months at least most probably longer , this is for all countries this virus is n't going away soon 
Let see , who say I leave it to the governor in the first  and stand on the sidelines be a cheerleader ? . 
Raúl D'Cotti Alicea 
Raúl D'Cotti Alicea I have to pay rent , 's , credit card . No one is waiting for me . It took time to have a good credit I 'm not going to ruined it now . Re open mr president . 
wants to open up the economy so he can go golfing and hold more of his ego stroking rallies 
More and more people are outside now ! It ’s time to let us get out ! At least to work on our yards/ houses . It ’s bs we ca n’t buy garden supplies ! 
has no clue how destructive his rash decisions are . It 's good there are people who can defy his orders . 
We should start living our life but extra careful . How are we going to pay our bills if we stayed like these ? ! ? ! I think most people are done staying at home unless if you ’re lazy . 
Are those the same governors that denied that there was a a virus going around they was saying go out mingle there 's nothing to worry about allows the ones that you 're talkin about 
You may think you can hide from this but you ca n't .. Being alive isn t the same thing as living .. This will not end until we all get it .. Stop living in fear open it up 
has been on Point and more believable America is waiting for him to tell us when it 's safe to return . We can , t believe a FAILURE 
If he opens and cases still going on either this whole thing is a political hoax or he needs relieve of his duty as 
They said they have powers as governors to implement policy but when they fail they are quick to blame , they might call him racist too ! ! 
Dutch 
Dutch will have to decide whether or not to declare martial law then . There is a difference between quarantine and martial law . I do n't see it going over very well . 
That 's why a lot of the states did n't have a mandatory shut down . Because of the governors . If he had called for a mandatory across the board shutdown of all states and then the Democrats would go after him for going against the Constitution 
It will interesting to see if more local or state governments open or closed by the political party held by each 
Federal guidelines are just recommendations governors set the rules for each state as needed 
And if they do not open when he wants he will have a temper tantrum and cut federal funding to those states . help the people who live in red states they will be forced back to work and more lives will be lost 
If trump wants to stimulate the economy . He s going to have to come up with some real money . . That $  . Is gon na be for food and bills . No gravy on that steak . 
Suddenly , has rediscovered the Constitution . ( Only when it ’s convenient ) The President has tried to defer to the when possible throughout this ordeal . Once again , the genius of the founders is on full display . 
He wants wants wants ... why did n't he want to do things in January about this when he received information about what was going on instead of waiting until March . 
Better to reopen it now , much longer lockdown , much big problem to the community 's economic matter and providing neccesities per family . Just make it sure to were sugical mask or N mask , or improvise mask , to lessen the passing of the virus . Its the … mult 
Thank . Or else we 'll all end up in the cemetery because the idiot in chief only cares about lining his pockets , not about the people . 🤬 🤬 
Do not reopen the country until new cases have subsided ! ! ! ! 
All of you thanking he does n’t have the power to open the country , are the same people screaming for him to lock it down , and that he was n’t doing enough ! 
So were you being ignorant then , or just hypocrites now ? 
He did n’t do a national shutdown so he ca n’t run the opening . Zero rallies until late Summer at soonest 
If there is any upside to this crisis , it has given us all a feel for life in a Socialist country 
matters more than the economy . We can come back from a recession , but we ca n’t come back from the grave . 
I would n't listen to he did nothing to help people leaving states to fend for themselves 
N.Y. is failing in every aspect and has been pulling the rest of the Country Down with it as Cali has been for decades . 
It ’s odd that never took this stance when it came to ’s executive orders .... 
I 'm grateful it will be up to Governor and not the idiot in the white house . 
They 'll bend to the will of the people or be voted out 
Leslie 
orange man only wants votes and will do anything to hold his power . If we fall for his LIES and CORRUPTION we are doomed . 
The health and well being of America is in the hands of the IN C. is the president of America and he will have the final decision . 
Saving lives important saving economy important both had to move together understand but economy first ... # Godcomment ... 
The closest person to the people , the governor of the state , is the one who is close to them and feels them , and faces direct pressure , not behind the palaces and television screens . 
Let em do what they want , then ppl can blame them ! ! ! 
This whole thing was a farced up hype by the media to control Americans . WAKE UP PEOPLE ! ! ! ! 
So wait , you blame for not closing the country , but acknowledge that he does n’t actually have the power to close down or reopen it ? ? Wow , journalism died a long time ago . 
Last week you were complaining about wanting to control states now you 're saying the opposite . Well , which one is it ? ? 
wants to cherry pick thru the government . Either its up to the States or the effing Federal government steps the Eff up ... 
Thank there are firewalls between him and some states , locals . He will surely kill a lotta people in states and locales without strong leadership 
How can you put a date on a virus ? ? It will leave when its defeated or finished with us . 🤔 😱 
That is almost like a confession / admission that it 's not fault . 
Of course it 's the governors that will have to answer for it when the plan goes south . 
We can resume if everybody has it ’s own Personal Protective Equipment ! ! ! Produce it for each people . 
Keep the hot spots closed , vulnerable , shelter in  , small businesses start to open back up with social distancing and masks . Poverty kills too . 
Thx . to gov and mayor de blabber mouth and their unpreparedness and unwillingness to deal with the matter in due time , thousands have died needlessly ! ! !
