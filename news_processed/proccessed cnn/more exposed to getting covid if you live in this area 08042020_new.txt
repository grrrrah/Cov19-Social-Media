No brainer . Pollution like smoking is hazardous to one 's health and affects the condition or well ness of the body 's respiratory system . Perhaps , one reason that have aided the explosion of active COVID cases . 
Katongole 
proof that this thing is in the Atmosphere , the only vaccine will be the Strength of your SOUL . 
Charging it NOW before it ’s too late . 
Really ? High pollution could exhastrabate a respitory infection ? ! Next thing you know they 're going to tell us that a significant number of those that have died already were long time smokers ... 
( Cigarette lobbiests would never allow that ) 
I live in the foothills of  giant California fires ... I am worried about our population here

Maverking " We need to develop more systems that can detect and see this virus around us . The emphasis is being d on reducing its spread . While that is a great thing . We need the Authorities to develop measures to visualize this parasite " . , 
not causation . Those d are also the most densely populated s . That 's probably the main reason for increased infections . 
Wow ... we ca n’t get tests , people are dying and is publishing more stories to drive fear ... why ? That is the right question ... stay alert 
No , not true ... you are likely to die from stress , frustrations , helplessness , false hopes , desperations , wishfull thinking , spiteful feelings , slanderous attitude , practice hostility and violence , scheming for rogues , collusions , chaos , coup if you are a Democrat and a fan of 
If you live in an area with a lot of supporters and believers 😥 😥 😥 
The reason is that the counties are in more densely populated areas . 
Day by day New York is becoming the worst city of the world . 
Lenoir 
journalism ... this research lacks concrete evidence . Some African cities as well as Indian cities are heavily polluted and we cope well with respiratory illnesses ( asthma ) and many more . Tell Americans the truth , hard drug abuse is doing a number on the infected cases . 
Obviously the most heavily populated areas are the most likely to be infected ... because ... ya ’ know ... more people ... ? 
If the written idea is true we should remember what the former prime minister of Ethiopia told to the world about climate change . I think he explained the consequence of climate change and what we are to do to improve the climate change 
" We know the counties that have higher pollution levels historically , " she said . " We know that even if they [ the counties ] have n't experienced high number of deaths yet , that would be one of their higher risks . " 
Maybe because the counties with high pollution are also the counties most densely populated ? Densely populated = higher likelihood of transmission .

Is n't it GREAT .. all other causes of death have now ceased to exist .. no one is dying anymore except for those infected with this virus , so once this is cured no one will be dying anymore ! ! ! !

Since I was little I have dreamed to go to the USA . Until now that the situation is worse I still wanna go there . My country Uganda has only  covid  cases but it 's so complicated from the president to the chairman 
Also if you live in the United States they are willing to ask you to risk your life of countless voters to contact the virus so they stay in power . 
Yes . Germs and outbreaks correspond with urban areas . We do n't have to correlate EVERY urban societal issue to Coronavirus . I understand your hacks are bored .... but please ... just shut down . 
Georgia 
getting worried about this.we had too much population here 
is heavily polluted but least death from the virus . So how do y’ all come up with such statistics . Same as india ! ! ! ! ! 
Seems like you have a greater risk of catching the virus if you live in one of the crowded cities . That in itself would increase your risk of death . 
min 
n't do a study on something when we can barely test a population 
I wonder if they bothered to correlate the higher risk of death in cities governed by Democrats . 
Ellis 
pollution has been around for years and years we have known the dangers thereof just sort it but do n't tell us it new IDIOTS 
mortality in LA ( Hollywood smog ) versus NYC , seems to contradict the whole premise of this article . Check the daily data on ’s Hopkins Covid map . 
min 
Those counties are typically ones that have higher population densities so people are more exposed to other people that could have the disease . It may have nothing to do with air pollution . 
That ’s because no one has found the cure and more people dying or people turn domestic violence because of cabin fever , quarantine is hurting everyone making them look worst . 
This is a very difficult situation and what I do n't like is ( complain ) 
If there 's something you can do to help , do it but if not let 's keep our mind on what we are doing it 's not easy we must surely defeat coronavirus , no need for complain . 
What ? ! ? You mean like big cities ? Like you ’re more likely to catch a contagious disease in areas of highly dense populations rather than in more sparsely populated rural areas ? You do n’t say . 
In a country in the united states ? 
You are more likely at risk if you listen to the President Of The United States ... Regardless of where you live ... Period . 
It is really terrifying that death is likely to be caused in such counties . It is increasing the anxiety all the more and the risk of death increases . It us quite appalling to read that no appropriate action has been taken as the covid  patients are exposed to risks affecting lung , kidney etc and they are playing with the lives of the residents in U.S. 
You are more likely to die from covid if you live in the US 
This is a circus here 
Worst tan any undeveloped country 😢 
Well duh .... and you 're more likely to die from a tornado if you live in the midwest . What would we do without # ? 
Burger 
Burger is not causation . Surprise metropolitan counties have higher rates 🙄 
It 's obvious cause of weak lungs or respiratory system ! 
It 's like the Earth is literally fighting back strategically ... 
You mean highly populated areas where you are much more to be exposed at higher levels ? 
and AP , can tell the entire citizens the way out ? 
Shut up and shut down the country like China in we ' will be OK You keep talking about people dying everyday . We let the whole world we are so weak wow 
Nasor A Nagel 
Nasor A Nagel Does this research do any good right now ? ? ? 
This caused so much panic to others but the hoped this might end sooner it will it 's just a matter of time 
we have choice to die from vaccines or covid . 
@realDonaldTrump today I heard that NY has lost more people than / . Sir under your watch . You understand the enormous situation that is happening in the US that is not happening in many other large populated countries , we in Australia flattened the curve , we live in rural Qld

And God himself will be with them .  . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and DEATH will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . The former things have passed away . ” 
The only hope for mankind .

cnn should be tried for murder for every patient that died reusing to take HYDROXYCHLORIQUIN because cnn lied .

cnn is the enemy of the people 
Kong lockdown is only for the poor people of the townships and villagers ! For the rich and politically connected , it is business as usual ! These politicians must be banned from talking without mask on TV ! because they do nt even follow their own rules ! 
I 'm starting to believe that cable News networks are not the most intelligent . They keep carrying the individual rally ( masked as the COVID briefing ) LIVE , all the while insults them and their reporters . They do n't need to carry it LIVE and assist in his lies . The reporters are there for a reason , LET THEM REPORT . Do n't give the platform .
