Republicans sold their stocks in January knowing that it was going to be a crisis . They , including that so called president , had the information but acted only in their own interests not the interest of their country and fellow . Now he 's blaming everyone but himself and his fellow Republicans , who are the ones to blame for this tragedy . 
place 
He ‚Äôs the reason we are in the condition we are in . He can not leave office soon enough . This is not his businesses ; he ca n‚Äôt keep treating this country the way he treats his employees . He fires anyone who opposes his idiocy . He ‚Äôs one of the weakest people I ‚Äôve ever witnessed . 
place 
, he 's right about this . Not sure if cut funding is the right approach , but definitely need to look into this as CCP gains control over more international organizations , which put CCP 's interest above all else . This is evidenced by the faulty recommendations WHO gave including called ( strongly ) against China travel ban while praise China 's lockdown 
place 
His narcissism is boundless other people are merely tools for his own aggrandizement . Protecting voting rights in November is critical if this country is to avoid the authoritarian abyss .

What a selfish man . Under his disastrous command the Covid cases have increased appallingly . There is no one to blame but and his team . The world üåé watches . 
place 
It ‚Äôs always someone else ‚Äôs fault . He wants everyone to believe he ‚Äôs the smartest person , a genius who surrounds himself with the greatest people . Yet everything always goes wrong , he ‚Äôs always firing his ‚Äú great ‚Äù people and it ‚Äôs someone else who did him wrong . He should write county songs . üéª 
place 
In my opinion , this administration was slow on the response . Regardless , if he thinks the WHO ‚Äôs response was inadequate , how does CUTTING funding help ? They will fare better with less funding ?

His idea of leadership is wildly swinging a big stick while calling people names and blaming someone(anyone ) else for his failures .

He should . WHO is in bed with China . Fact check WHO ; their withholding of the truth about Covid is why Italy and other countries were not prepared . FYI ... other countries are working together in talks about how they are going to hold China and the WHO pay for their criminal ( YES CRIMINAL ) acts .

The timing is wrong probably , but is right . Who led us into this crisis , they were not proactive in December and January .

First it was the ‚Äò impeachment distraction ‚Äô , then the Chinese , then the Governors and now its the WHO . All of his smoke and mirrors ca n‚Äôt distract us from the fact that it is his incompetence that is costing American lives .

WHO gave notice to everyone , sorry our brain dead leader did n‚Äôt listen ! ! Please everyone , help is end this craziness . We have a government out of control

WHO lost its credibility . 
Should set up an independent committee and investigate WHO Director General relationship with CCP .

place 
He is not wrong . WHO has been reduced to mouthpiece of China while other countries are watching by . USA taxpayers are the largest funders to WHO however they are getting misinformation in return . WHO has been consistently giving misinformation since January regarding Covid.The above statements should have come from a Democrat nominees , not sure what are they doing either .

No surprise . In the very day we found out about the two memos sent to him warning about the pandemic and the disastrous loss of American lives to come ... Such a liar . Takes no responsibility about anything .Blames everybody but himself .

In my point of view as an ordinary citizen , blames must be put forward in order for things to move on . This is common sense , especially during a disastrous period of time .
