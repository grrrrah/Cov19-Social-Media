While not advocating in any way that we ignore scientists on the subject ( quite the opposite in fact ) it would be good for people to remember that “ the economy ” is not just the stock market . 
It ’s your food , your medicine , your essentials and the supply chain that brings it all to you

Any attempt to reopen the economy before we are really finished with this pandemic will result in a second wave of the pandemic and even more deaths . The health of our economy is very important , but the lives of Americans are more important .

It ’s not ’s decision whether or not the country reopens . Those decisions lay with the governors and mayors of states and cities across the country who issued stay at home and lockdown orders . They enacted them and they alone have the power to retract them , not .

The only people that will go back out on 's word are his supporters . For the nonsupports we can listen to our governors , stay home quarantined and see how it works out for the supporters that went back out when he told them too . What do the non supporters have to lose ? Zero .
