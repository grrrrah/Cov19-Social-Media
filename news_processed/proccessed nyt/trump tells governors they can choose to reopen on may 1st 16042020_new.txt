It 's a trap . Do n't open unless he explicitly forces you to . He is trying to play it safe . If a nd wave occur due to opening he will blame the governers if it do n't he will take the credit . 
You should just lift the ban on all trump supporters though . Let them all go to rallies and give hugs and kisses to one another . It 's their freedom to do so .
