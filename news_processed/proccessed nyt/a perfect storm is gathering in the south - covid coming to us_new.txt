When this is all over and we are all back to work or going to social events again . I will not forget the governors who worked tirelessly to get the supplies they needed for their states , who stood up against and his enablers , who listened to scientists , and spoke the truth ! They will be the hero ’s of this time !

A whole truck load of prayers is n't going to help anything . Prayers are excuses ; surrogates for true assistance . As Ingersoll wrote : " Hands that help are better far than lips that pray . "

I have been saying this for weeks . I have been pouring over articles and watching trends . The south is a perfect nightmare storm . Not touched on in this article are the underlying health issues high in the south as well , obesity , smoking , hypertension , diabetes , black lung . Add that to religion and trumpism . It 's going to be a very bad time . Sad

is n’t in the south , but we may as well be ! Our republican governor has not yet issued a stay at home order and our rural communities will pay the price . The population is older with very few hospitals and some do n’t even have ICU beds .

I agree , its another ignorant decision 
But it has been said over and over that isolation is neccesary . This is why some people have to be forced to isolate
