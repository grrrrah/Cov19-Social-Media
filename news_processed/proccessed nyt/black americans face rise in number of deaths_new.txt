The impact and evidence of historical , structural inequities .

And also , those figures are from a census a decade ago . I think we 'll find something different this time around 
place 
This would n't be a revelation if we had listened to decades of black and minority communities telling us health services ( and jobs and wages and safety net programs , and etc etc ) were insufficient . 
place 
I 'm trying to see if the Center of Disease Control has research study on this or the World Health Organization has some kind of Statistics because all I 'm seeing or articles for magazines and quotes from mayors . The last time I checked the mayor is not a professional medical personnel I want to see real deal statistics

That is a great job giving people a false sense of safety . Woman is taking another woman ’s temperature and is not even close to ’apart . Why are places putting people at higher risk to “ appear ” it is to protect them ?

if you are sick . It 's vital to stop the pooling of liquid in your lungs . If you lie down on your back , you block off the main little airways in your lungs , which are mostly at your back . Deep breathe a lot , even when it hurts . Cough regularly . … Vezi mai mult

There is a lot of trouble with social distancing in Chicago ; the police have already broken up hundreds of gatherings .

Many of us would prefer “ meaningful ” to “ sweeping ” information . 
place 
This is purely speculation but I attribute it to general poorer overall health in poorer communities , more cramped environments , ignorance and higher involvement in service positions that are either essential or without benefits . A perfect storm . 
place 
Why write an article until you have enough data ? Your article even points that out , " data is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions . " It 's just poor journalism and all speculation just to create a narrative .

EM 
they HAVE to work and they work in jobs like retail , cleaning , etc . Fewer of our African Americans have the kind of jobs where they can work from home , so as a result they have greater exposure rates .

Could it be that people in the black community are more likely to care for their elderly at home than to ship them to nursing homes ?

The us and their obsession with race and promoting segregation ... matter of time media ! Well done !

BOTH of these areas have known issues with socioeconomic related health issues where the areas that rely on government health care services have so much RED TAPE that the impoverished areas , ( which are predominantly black ) , are hindered from utilizing … Vezi mai mult

I wonder what the percentages would be if we break the numbers by class instead of race . 
place 
Because a lot of the essential workers ( in restaurants , grocery stores , gas stations ) are minorities . It 's shameful and sad , but not entirely surprising . 
place 
that 's because they are not doing all the things to protect them selves 
place 
So we have lockdowns , shutdowns and mass job losses , but ( " everyone " ) can still visit the Supermarket ? Hmmmmm 🤔

people in the comments hate the racial talk but it 's true . We all can get it but the studies show there are socioeconomic disparities as far as treatment and access . Please do n't say it does n't discriminate . That 's not the point . Read the full article please and stop all lives mattering everything 
place 
I 'm an RN . Wash your hands , practice good hygiene . When your state institutes social distancing , do it . COVID does n't discriminate . You can keep yourself safe . 
place 
Data on race and the coronavirus is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions , but here we go anyways . 
place 
How about instead of this , you tell us the rates of people who earn under $ k and the people who earn over $ k , or people with paid leave / sick days vs without , with health insurance vs. without . I have a feeling that would explain this and point to the real divide . 
place 
Probably income inequality . If you have more money saved , you can go longer without work . Might have more room for storage and need to shop less . 
place 
We need a House committee to be immediately established to determine how is the best way to blame this on . To the crybaby mobile ! 
place 
Always on the receiving end , make no mistake not to believe that the federal government may institute draconian law to quarantine black communities separate from others . 
place 
When the hasidics in New York City faced an alarming rate of measles they were blamed for it . 
place 
Probably because of poverty and the fact that they ca n't properly social distance when in gov housing . High concentration areas where it 's the worst . But ca n't blame the system for that right ? 
place 
Evidence of pollution impacting Covid outcomes may also be relevant as minority neighborhoods are more likely to have escalated pollution levels . 
place 
Because they wo n't listen to the stay at home order . Jackson Tennessee PD are constantly breaking up street parties where there are nearly  people plus in the streets dancing and partying . It 's ridiculous . 
place 
Some people are n't taking it seriously enough by wearing the proper PPE . 
place 
The problem is underlying conditions like copd due to excessive smoking and this is a respiratory outbreak . Those  together do n't match . Pretty sad for us .

Current generation snowflakes can not manage talking about racial profiling in these situations

surely plays a role here , as do general health issues such as diabetes .

Guess who gets to stay home and work while the others deliver food to them .

We 've been warned of this bias / discrimination long before and now we are only reaping what 's been sowed , not doing much about it . A fine example of structural racism in action in America 
place 
Because they can not follow social distancing .. so many videos of afro american fighting police .. 
place 
either black Americans immune response to COVID  is week or their community does not enforce preventive measures .

It could n't be economic situation , but race , right ?

Perhaps most of them do n't have good healthcare ? Or scared to go to the hospital because the high cost of medical ? We need healthcare like Europe where no one ever second guessing whenever they are sick and going to hospital 
place 
Most likely due to ignoring of social distancing protocols . 
place 
can also be read as “ black voters “
