In times of crises , people have been able to remove leaders who consistently show a lack of compassion , insight , wisdom , leadership . Republicans holding on to this " violin strumming " argues the other dynamic wherein fear and greed propel insanity and finality . I would argue that history will judge us all , but perhaps we will be spared that gross humility , for perhaps there will be no history left to examine .  is a nightmare .

The worst thing is that in order to hide his negligence in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and in the face of the immense unemployment in that country , he intends to invade Venezuela with the excuse of fighting drug trafficking , something that will directly harm Colombia and cause an unprecedented crisis in the entire region . Furthermore , we all know that the only thing the United States wants is Venezuela 's oil , because if it really wanted to fight drug trafficking , it would have invaded Colombia a long time ago or requested extradition from Mr. and the inept . 
The paradox is that while the United States is generously receiving help from the peoples of Russia and China to combat the coronavirus , and while Colombia is also receiving aid from Venezuela for exactly the same thing , the miserable response of the United States and Colombia is to threaten Venezuela economically and militarily . 
Unacceptable !
