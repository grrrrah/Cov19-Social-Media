There are points worth dying to make in this country and these people miss the point entirely . They are putting their lives and the lives of others on the line so they can rush back to cog the wheels of the wealthy . How about they protest the income inequality that is causing the hardship . How bout protesting the for profit health care system or rigged elections .... this is literally the most heartbreaking display of stupidity I have seen yet .

Uhmmm ... as a foreigner , I 've been taught in school the US rests on three basic principles ... right to life , liberty and and the pursuit of happeness ... their placards emphasize their in intention to protect right to liberty yet in those three stated principles , the first that must be protected is the right to life ... is n't that what the quarantine and the lockdowns are supposed to do , protect the right to life ?

All you need to know about this protest : 
‚Äú The protest ‚Äî dubbed " Operation Gridlock " ‚Äî was organized by the Conservative Coalition and the Freedom Fund , a family linked conservative group . ‚Äù 
place 
In , they blocked all entrances / exits to Sparrow Hospital , including AMBULANCE entrances . There is video of an ambulance that was struggling to make it through their traffic jam to get someone to the hospital . Differences of opinion are one thing but endangering lives by blocking ambulances and ambulance entrances is unconscionable .. ....

What to the actual F**K ? ? ? I did n‚Äôt see people protesting in other countries about a stay in place order .

I used to have off task students who said that they did n‚Äôt have to learn if they did n‚Äôt want to . My response was that they were correct . However , they did n‚Äôt have the right to keep others from learning because of their behavior .

These scenes look terrifying to me and I live in a country where we are all entitled to healthcare that is free at the point of delivery . 
What is horrible with scenes like this is they are n't just choosing their own " freedom " but probably directly choosing to take away from doctors , nurses and others their freedom to be alive .

Misleading headline NYT . These protests are organized and well funded not grass roots demonstrations
