There are points worth dying to make in this country and these people miss the point entirely . They are putting their lives and the lives of others on the line so they can rush back to cog the wheels of the wealthy . How about they protest the income inequality that is causing the hardship . How bout protesting the for profit health care system or rigged elections .... this is literally the most heartbreaking display of stupidity I have seen yet .

Uhmmm ... as a foreigner , I 've been taught in school the US rests on three basic principles ... right to life , liberty and and the pursuit of happeness ... their placards emphasize their in intention to protect right to liberty yet in those three stated principles , the first that must be protected is the right to life ... is n't that what the quarantine and the lockdowns are supposed to do , protect the right to life ?

I 've posed the following question to NYS " mask protesters " on several sites . They do n't reply ... Would you sign a DNR to keep your " right " to not wear a mask ?

I used to have off task students who said that they did n’t have to learn if they did n’t want to . My response was that they were correct . However , they did n’t have the right to keep others from learning because of their behavior .

These scenes look terrifying to me and I live in a country where we are all entitled to healthcare that is free at the point of delivery . 
What is horrible with scenes like this is they are n't just choosing their own " freedom " but probably directly choosing to take away from doctors , nurses and others their freedom to be alive .
