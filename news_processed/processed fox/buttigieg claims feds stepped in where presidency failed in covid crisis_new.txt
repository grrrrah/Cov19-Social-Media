The states that are struggling had poor leadership to begin with ... that 's why they are struggling . They are the ones that always have their hands out for a bailout because they mismanage their own responsibilities . If they had their own crap together and had a plan in place then the federal government could pick up and help out in a supplemental way not in a primary manner . That 's called socialism when you expect the federal government to handle all aspects of your life ... and that has been real pleasant for all of us has n't it ? Groceries and supplies rationed , people struggling out of work , being told when and where we are allowed to go , propaganda from the mainstream media / . This is a great way to live üôÑ . How about everyone do their part ( state and local levels ) so we are n't completely dependent on one division ( feds ) . This is what happens when the generation of everyone gets a participation trophy " leads " .
