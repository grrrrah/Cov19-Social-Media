Mark Lerro Trump has FAILED THE COUNTRY. For weeks he said it was a Democrat Hoax. FOX news said it was a Conspiracy by the “Deep State”. These are criminal actions that led to the deaths of Americans. Shameful.

Kelly Fowler I think it would be helpful, as we look toward reopening to assign tiers of high and lower risk interactions. For instance gathering with a friend who has been socially isolating also would be considered a low risk. Going to a concert in a NYC club might be considered a high risk. While much of this is common sense, people will need guidance.

John M. Gonzales I appreciate his ability to succinctly plan a way forward that isn’t rash and causing a reinfection arch of COVID. I also appreciate he called Trump directly to speak about these concepts. It’s important ALL Americans can safely move forward. That isn’t a Democrat or Republican issue. Bravo former VP Biden. Let’s hope these measures can get implemented.

Joy Rough REQUEST: Please all of those on here with their revere trump chatter kindly provide all the reasons he is all that. I dare you. As opposed to the same old comment provided by the hoax himself or some campaign manager. If the only reason you have is to suggest that Biden is not mentally stable, then seems to me it becomes a matter of who between him & donnie are the least mentally stable.

Alan Jay Biden didn’t come up with this on his own. I’ve been a teacher and can tell when the slow ones are cheating by using someone else’s ideas. Who’s holding his puppet strings? Maybe they should be running for President.

Soooo, now grandpa Biden and Saint Cuomo want to start discussing “reopening” as well. Don’t these people ever get tired of being behind President Trump? It was spun as horrible and irresponsible by the mainstream media when he began suggesting it just a few days ago. I’m guessing the concept just got a LOT more intelligent in the last 24 hours. Call it a hunch.

"Mayor de Blasio said critics shouldn’t question him about telling New Yorkers to go about their lives until “this war is over.”"

Would he donate money or resources to his home city (It used to be NYC)? Would he be proactive and offer a comprehensive plan to safely reopen the ecinomy??
Honestly how do you think Donald Trump would react to the situation????
