Gary Handsom All they saying is it effects people in different ways.. Some people immune system is stronger that may never show symptoms..Some may take time to show symptoms when the immune system breaks down. Some with weak immune systems show symptoms right off bat..

Patricia Place No kidding... But there are still people who insist that this is "just a flu", even though it's from an entirely different family of viruses, is more contagious than the flu, is contagious during the long incubation period, and has a much higher fatality rate than the flu.
