Sharon Armbruster Morris Please follow the logic of the medical community. Your state and local officials are doing just that. They could care less about how popular these decisions make them. Be grateful they want to save your life, not exploit it for egotistical gain.

I'm sure most will know when it will be safe to reopen. Businesses as well have the leeway to stay closed if they can afford to if things are still uncertain when he wants to open everything back up. I'm just praying daily this situation will improve soon 🙏

Subhasis Biswas Time and again President Trump said that he will go along with the local leaders in their decision to close or open. I do not understand why CNN is having hiccup with that. But frankly, being a resident of New Jersey, I wish he sent military and took over NY and NJ earlier and enforce quarantine that would have saved tens of thousands of lives!!

Jeffrey Crapo What they’re trying to say is that the Democrats feel they have the power the Democratic governors to screw the people for their agenda. Remember the Democrats do not work for the American people obviously they fought the president on everything he does even though he’s done a way better job than Obama could even dream in his where his dreams. But Americans don’t care what the governors think we care what’s right and economy needs to get going and the Democratic governors want to stall it to ruin trumps economy just to screw the American people. But we the American people realize how evil and corrupt the fake news in the Liberal party has become and that’s why so many of us stand with President Trump

Scott DeWitt
Scott DeWitt Democratic Governors attempting to drive the economy into the ground by prolonging a shutdown in their respective states for political gain will only face harsh criticism and backlash from their own citizens after other Governors open up their states and thrive. They’ll bask in their own misery.

John Kerry And Trump's statement and desire to open economy early and not listen to the medical community, should ensure you get millions for your civil lawsuit! File after he leaves office and you could be on for compensation for his acts. A death of a loved one or permanently affected individual, because of Trump's inaction and false claims! Remember, you could be rewarded millions!

You got nothing but an agenda to disregard what he’s actually saying and doing to fill your negative narrative. What a load.

David Caldwell If you are at home, not working, and under any kind of shelter in place orders, it is because of your governor or employer, not the president. Of course federal employees are under the direction of the executive branch. The federal government can issue guidelines but it is the governors that have the power. The executive branch can do things like stop international travel, but not much more.

printing more relief funds.
Recall candidate Trump saying; “Just print more money,” Dare so! Political leaders are walking a global economic/health awareness tightrope. Just

Anyway the governor and mayor of New York who are Democrats weren’t that serious when it came to shutting down New York since it took them down till there were 25,000 infections before shutting down and they had vowed that they wouldn’t shut down no matter what. The mayor of New Orleans let Mardi Gras go on and many of the infections came from that celebration and that was deep into the outbreak and he is also a Democrat and the same goes on for many other cities

Madeline Caporale Trump cannot have it both ways. He did not want responsibility and left it to the states and the mayors, who retain the power to leave in effect or remove stay at home orders. Now he has to live with that. I would suggest rather than focus on the economy he focus on the public health and healthcare aspects. Businesses cannot function without healthy employees. Prime example, today a national meat processing company announced it is closing down operations due to the virus. While I was dismayed with the first quarter report from my retirement fund, I still am not ready to die just so Trump can get the economy up for his billionaire friends.
