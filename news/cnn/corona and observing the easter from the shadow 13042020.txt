If these people who insist on physically going to church, they have the right to do that. But then they should stay in their homes so they don’t spread their “freedom” to the rest of us. And they should not use up a hospital bed or a ventilator or put the lives of doctors and nurses in jeopardy.

Kathryn Finster If you truly carry God in your heart then he is where you are all the time. Whether you are in your home alone or with your family. When you pray he hears you. You don't have to be gathered together exposing yourself to the virus ravaging countries right now. Stay home. Pray. Have faith.

Laura Vega Follow the rules.... so you do not want to, but then everyone else pays. We want to go to church and maybe to our families homes but we don't for the the good of all. Many people have died and sacrificed so that one day we all could enjoy some kind of normal life sooner not later. Let's see how many people transferred virus.

Stephanie Green
Stephanie Green Proving yet again that the pro-life movement is a false religion meant to scam gullible voters. God doesn't want you to infect your neighbor. Anyone claiming to be a Christian and purposefully goes against health professionals during a pandemic are not real Christians. Their selfishness is deadly.

Ashraf Ashraf In the name of the Merciful God Hi Corona is only a very weak virus, but by your fear of it and your followers of Satan's steps, you made him a deadly killer. Corona is a manipulated virus that is placed inside the planted eggs Therefore, whoever wants to stop the spread of this virus, he must stop eating imported imported eggs, as well as cans of tuna, canned fish Most likely the eggs are the main cause of the spread of the virus The proof is what I say 1. How this virus reached the Dutch submarine crew 2. How he arrived to the crew of the American flagship in the middle of the oceans 3. How did he reach the affected cruise ships? 4.How it spread in the tourist cities in Italy and Europe 5. Iran is not the largest importer of Chinese eggs 6.

David Overton
David Overton I’m a lifelong Democrat and I’m voting for Donald Trump in November. I voted for Obama twice but since they have dubbed Biden the nominee I’m done. He’s a career politician pure garbage and a pedophile. I’d rather have four more years of the Trump economy than waste it on someone like Joe Biden. Hopefully democrats come up with someone better in 2024
