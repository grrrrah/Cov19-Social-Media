Elizabeth McGee We need to cut off contact with China. We can create our own factories here in the United States for the things we need. The Chinese government is not reliable and we need to take that into consideration when we shipped our factory businesses overseas to them. We need to bring it back to the United States.

Diane Olsvanisk There are only two plausible explanations for the low numbers of death in China. 1. They under reported the mortality 2. They knew exactly how contagious and deadly this virus was in the population. Totally shutting down Wuhan's economy for an "unknown virus" so drastically would suggest .... They knew!

Aris Aquino After this Covid19 Pandemic is over, China will be in unimaginable pressure from International Community to explain the whole origin of this virus. And Chinese gov’t will need to make a significant help to those affected to somehow tilt some balance on this growing animosity on them & how they handled the outbreak yet then. Otherwise there will be war🤬

Marky Casas It's about time to probe this country. The virus, as we all know, originated from China. If they refuse to cooperate and disclose vital information that can help fight this pandemic, I think each affected country has the right to demand sanctions and penalties from them. This is not a racist rant, it's about accountability. We demand justice for the lives lost and suffering from this crisis.

No virus in this world can be this much dangerous for the human life which get infected thru any animal it's definitely not the animal supplied disease, it's the biological war started by Chinese government, unfortunate but true 😢😢

Richard Fitting The Spanish flu originally came from a pig farm in Kansas. You don't hear about that. It was called Spanish flu because it was detrimental in Spain. So it seems that man writes history and history does not write its self.

Séamus Ó hAodha Epoch Times has already exposed China as being 100% responsible for creating and dispersing this biological weapon to impact the world. They use citations from papers published over the last 6 years in a variety of peer reviewed scientific and medical journals. China MUST be held accountable for their world wide attack.

Bob Smith So it's a bioweapon. Isolated for purpose and released for purpose. The truth is eventually going to come out and then the world needs to take a China, as a nation, break it into many smaller Nations, and set democratically elected leadership for the future. China's governmental wealth should be used to reimburse the world for its expenses due to covid-19.

Or to twist the information to wage a propaganda war against them? Or maybe it's just pure capitalist. Keep it to yourself and make the most profit? Hard to say with today's selfish politics.
