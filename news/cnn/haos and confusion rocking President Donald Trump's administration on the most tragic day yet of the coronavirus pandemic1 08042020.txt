Mike Savion Frazier He is woefully illequipped to handle a crisis of this magnitude or the country for a matter of fact and that goes for his administration as well. Due toTrump's narcasistic personality and his inability to listen and heed the advice of the medical subject matter experts our country and its citizens will continue to suffer in all regards. Medically, financially and economically...

Lilian Atieno My heart goes out to all Americans and their families losing their loved ones. Personally I didn't expect any deaths in USA, this is a country so advanced in all ways. I thought the leadership would control it right from the start, immediately China locked down. Very disappointing. My heart goes out to the families.

Norma Roden It’s called chaos, panic, hair on fire. He is completely panicked with no idea what to do so he chooses to shift blame, point fingers, criticize, fire people......absolutely no leadership whatsoever. New Yorkers should be forever grateful for Gov. Cuomo. He has been focused and on the task at hand every moment. New York will survive in spite of trump not because of him.

Mike Lathouras What is seen of the USA today is like the last days of the Roman empire. Corruption, nepotism, vested interests driving government policy, loss of empathy towards its citizens. A President like DT is but a symbol of the malaise. Yours is a great country. Please save it for all our sakes.

I am not a Trump supporter but if I were to attend his press conference, I would b ed armed and ready.
