Hydro Nani Many are in the eye 👁 of the storm ☔️ ⛈ and have front line jobs, living paycheck to paycheck and , have little to no health care insurance. All stimulus money 💰 should have been money used for a proper health care system for everyone before the Covid-19 episode. We pay enough taxes to at least deserve that much.

Francis Butters Rivadeneira
Francis Butters Rivadeneira One detail that the opinion misses is that 4/5 of all rush hour commuters in NYC, use public transportation.
The city was also slow in closing schools and limiting travel and operations altogether.
During this key moments of the spread of the disease, it was free to move alongside the millions of people that took public transit during those early days.
The two countries most devastated by the disease are Kongs and Queens, which is where the working people of the city reside. It so happens that those same two are where the majority of the commuters of color reside; this is where the two considerations intersect and where race and medical coverage appear to be the causes, where they are just another ingredient. The crowding inside the subway, even two weeks ago, was unbelievable. Even the cleaning of the subway cars and the use of protection for the crews was very late. It should be considered by the author.

George Brietigam The easiest and most obvious explanation is usually the correct one. NYC’s population density is insane. Everyone is packed in together and everyone takes public transit. A lot more opportunities for transmission. Even in Los Angeles, we’re pretty spread out compared to NYC

And before anybody says anything, I already know I'm a terrible person.
This virus is definitely looking for the weak and you can't blame the virus for that.
Since moving forward we have to deal with this and possibly other recurrences or viruses people really need to take personal responsibility for their habits.

Melissa Elaine Stop trying to use this to push socialized medicine. The reason is because there are over 8 million people living in tiny spaces and pushing around all over each other in public spaces. Also, it didn't help matters that the mayor of NYC and governor of NY had a very liberal approach in leaving the city and state open for way too long after the pandemic hit this country. NYC should have been on lockdown about 3 weeks before the mayor and governor took any action. Pathetic.

Kelli Quinn Ohhhh so it has nothing to do with people crowded on top of each other, their germ ridden public transport system or the fact that they were slow to close schools and issue shelter-in-place - it's all race based. Thanks so much for explaining that to me

Omuterema Akhahenda That is one opinion. Another opinion is that we are being lied to and treatments have been available all along, but the WHO has been pushing it's own agenda of vaccines. I take L-Arginine for working out because I know it metabolizes into Nitric Oxide. Check this out

Russell Knippel This is a behavior driven disease. The world's large Progressive cities and the way they choose to live is why they've been hit the hardest. NYC has over half of our nation's cases. Detroit has over 80% of Michigan's cases. Liberals live like filth and they spread all sorts of diseases more than communities where people live decently.
