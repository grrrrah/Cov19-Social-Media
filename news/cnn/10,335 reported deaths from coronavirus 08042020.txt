Matthew McNees
Matthew McNees If COVID-19 was taken seriously at the federal level from the very beginning, we wouldn’t see as many Americans suffering or dying. President Trump needs to accept responsibility for his flawed actions, which are rooted to the devastation we are seeing each & everyday. He is not to blame for COVID-19, but he is responsible for his lack of preparation to prepare for it.

He doesn't deserve a 2nd term in office.

Hyun Kay Although we will have a tough week this week, The national trend of both new confirmed cases and death toll is actually down now. New Confirmed Cases : 32,500(4/3), 34,128(4/4), 25,927(4/5), 18,530(4/6 2:40 p.m.) I believe the curb is coming down in April. Stay home & stay safe.

Well, as you know now, the virus don’t care if you’re healthy, unhealthy, black, white old, young. It will kill you and you don’t know 100% if you will survive if you are infected with the virus. Stay inside, keep away from others.

Lewis Trout Well that's getting close to the number we lose to the flu every year. 12k-70k every year and nobody bats an eye. This the most over hyped disaster in history. With so called news sources running I interviews with ppl that claim millions can die. Constantly panicking the public. You can blame the media for all the suicide and the wrecked economy.

Many died from chronic diseases that are grouped in the COVID class because they coughed, had COPD, needed oxygen, or the test kit was contaminated with COVID to give a false positive. Furthermore, many died because of limitations by the state laws and government handling of the crisis.
