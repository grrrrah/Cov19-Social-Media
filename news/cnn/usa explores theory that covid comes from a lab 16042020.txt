Eugene Stark Trump's Theory of chloroquine as a Cure was debunked by a French study published today. So although the Theory that implicates the Wuhan lab, while possible, Looks, because Trump supports it, improbable.

David Holden Yes, we get it. Trump and his minions desperately want to blame someone for this. Enough already.
Yes, the Chinese government screwed up, tried to cover up their mistakes and are trying to revise this bit of history. So is the American administration. Don't we have enough real problems to deal with already

Kim Flynn Well I’m sure it would be great if we knew what the origin was.
Perhaps time would be better spent on finding a vaccine getting supplies to hospitals and frontliners So we can return to some sort of normalcy but this administration as usual wastes resources on the blame game and trying to rewrite history so #45 does not appear to be as big of a buffoon as he is

Brad Davis
Brad Davis The theory I read was that it was a wild virus that was captured and cultivated in the lab, then escaped (not intentionally released), when a lab worker became infected. This seems like a more likely scenario. The fact that there is a large virus research lab in Wuhan Province seems a bit too coincidental.

Jim Wehr Trump is doing a great job and all of you know it. While Pelosi is sitting in her multi-million dollar castle showing the world her stock pile of $24 per container of ice-cream sitting in her $24,000 refrigerator, Trump and his team are working hard everyday making sure the country has what it needs to get through this Chinese virus. CNN = Chinese News Network.

David J Oleson All part of the trump pandemic perception management plan. End testing to keep numbers low, blame China and WHO for his gross mismanagement and have fox news spouting happy talk by May. Distract from medical supply debacle by misappropriating 500 billion in recovery funds to his crime family after getting rid of any oversight. Sounds like making America great again!

At the beginning, Carrie Lam didn't close Hong Kong borders, she helped Wuhan Coronavirus spreading around the world from China. Now, Hongkongers and people around the world are suffering from her mistakes. She is a terrorist corrupted by Communists from China. FBI needs to investigate her foul play and bring her to justice.
