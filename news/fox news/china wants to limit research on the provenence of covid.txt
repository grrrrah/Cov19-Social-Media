He had names and dates for a research study being done by a Chinese researcher who now has disappeared. She was working with bats. The research center was located very close to the wet meat market. It's believed she contracted the virus and then workers disposing of her body also got it unknowingly and thus the spread began.

Bob Lob Law No employees are sick at the grocery store where my wife works . BUT she now recalls that back in Dec and Jan. everyone was out sick with : flu like symptoms with respiratory infection. She thinks that they have all been exposed and are now fine. We need anti-body testing on the retail sector regarding situations like this.

Also, they appear to be more likely to catch and die from covid-19. That usually shuts the bullies up..
