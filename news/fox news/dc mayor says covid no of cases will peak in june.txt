James Lee She is full of crap trying to prolonging the closing of our country. Time for an organized opening. We can not wait any longer. I urge ( ALL) small companys and large that love our country work with each other do what ever it takes to move forward and get the cash flowing for the greater cause, things will fall into place.

Frank Dhom i Would say go with her plan if she is given no wage and 13 of her retirement stripped (like 16 million that applied for unemployment and the rest that lost in their 401 Ks) as we go through this experiment ! It is easy to speak when not affected by policy put in place. Wake up Americans time to push back!

Camille Chasteen One thing the inaccurate COVID-19 models are showing is the extreme difficulty of forecasting anything of such scale. Data are ever changing. Makes it even harder to believe the models used by the climate change scientists.

Lee Burch You ever tried to cook crawdads by putting them into boiling hot water They will jump out of the pan. But if you put him in cool water and heat it up slowly over time. He will sit there and cook himself. It's the same thing with our rights and freedoms. Take them all at once and we would rebel. But do it slowly and we wouldn't know the difference.
