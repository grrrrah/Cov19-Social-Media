Vincent Santucci
Vincent Santucci That’s because everyone who dies these days is coded as “coronavirus related,” if they have tested positive for the virus, regardless of whether or not there’s proof the virus truly contributed to their death. This is per the CDC guidelines. It’s amazing that we’ve seen such dramatic drops nationwide in pneumonia and heart attack as the cause of death. Must be some kind of miracle.

Kenneth McClellan Remember cdc said if they have covid 19 but die of something else it still goes down as a covid 19 death even if it was an accident, heart attack, or what ever else. So is the numbers actually correct ? I think not.

Dawn R. Burke Well of course it is, since if you step off a curb and get hit by a bus, you are considered to have died from the virus if you test positive, regardless of whether you have symptoms or not. Almost everything is attributed to this virus. It's absolute insanity!!! Someone should step in and do something about this. The statistics are completely unreliable now. #Trump2020

Marci Winters Howard Sure, because every death is attributed to the virus if the person tested positive regardless of whether the virus actually was cause of death. At the very least they should classify those who have underlying conditions separately.

Michael Parrish The primary cause of death with influenza is either pneumonia or heart failure, using everyone’s dismal logic I guess there are no flu deaths. Covid 19 is not a virus, it’s a disease defined by symptoms, one of which is the presence of SARS-COV2 virus. The virus presence alone never is direct cause of death, death is always attributed to underlying organ failures with any virus.

Tammy Courville They making more out of this than it should be just to get more money for their elections and the things behind what the Coronavirus is hiding. Notice there are no pneumonia death. Heart attacks, strokes or overdoses it’s all coronavirus. We need to find the truth about a virus that has at least 30 different strings to it.

Anna Fowler
Anna Fowler This is very misleading. This is talking about deaths per day during its peak. It will not kill that many people per day for the rest of the year. And once it is over at the end of the year it will not be for the whole year. Also, this doesn't take into account all of the inflating they have done to death rates! No, wonder people hate the media

Brian Leto This is either untrue or unverified. The medical community has made it clear they are assigning CV19 to all deaths even if it was not the cause. If a patient tested positive for and they died hang gliding then they say it was CV19. Not happy with Fox. They know these numbers are not reliable.

Randy Broman Not true 647,000 people die of heart disease in the US annually, 606,880 from Cancer, so far we have had 16,676 die of Covid 19. Even if you average over the last 41 days and X by 365 the total comes out 148,458 deaths annually thats awesuming rates stay the same. So I think that FOX is also contributing to the scare tactics, shame on you FOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lars Johnson If you were to get in a car accident and die on our way to a clinic/hospital for treatment they would code you as a corona virus death...People are losing their grip on reality and not understanding how things work. Look past the headlines and start thinking for once

Nell Keener Because now it’s being used on death certificates incorrectly & because hospitals & docs have financial incentive to use CV to get bills paid up to 100%. People who are uninsured and die of other causes would be write offs (financially) not now just use magic word CV & ta da MONEY! Other numbers are artificially low. Time to go back to work America.

So are they saying CV deaths will rise to that 600,000 for the year? Pure fear mongering.

April Benton I dont believe the numbers anymore. Doctors have been told to classify all deaths as corona...even if they die of other underlying causes. Bogus info. Fear mongering.

Mark Anthony If I died of a heart attack tomorrow then was tested for COVID-19 postmortem, my death certificate will list it and I will be added to the death toll even though I am asymptomatic.

Robert Mason There is a persistent rumor that says hospitals receive $19K for each recorded Covid-19 death from Federal relief bill. I have not been able to confirm that, but there has to be SOME reason why they are recording so many deaths to CV-19, when facts show the persons died from other causes i many cases.

Kim Waid When each death is written off as a C-Virus one, then yes, that is the number one cause of death 🙄. The Washington Post even notes that the CDC is saying to declare deaths (whether founded or not) as the C-Virus.

Kerby Thompson How is that possible? Only a little over 18,000 deaths so far from this virus. Many people die every day from Heart Attacks, Cancer, and the like every day. In the United States the survivability rate is about 98%. Why isn’t the news reporting that?

Jodi Graybill I've just learned that hospitals get PAID when they have COVID19 patients. Who honestly believes those numbers are accurate anyways? If youd get paid $13k per person, you'd say they had coronavirus too... just saying... something to really think about.

Yvelise Hovey I think there is something wrong with the numbers. For one, they already said that if you died and happened to have COVID-19, they were putting that as the cause of death when it may have only made another condition worse and someone could have died from something they already had. Why do people not want to record truth and facts today?

Keith Hubbard No it’s not. You well know at Fox every single death, in every single hospital is being filed as a Covid 19 death so they can collect money from the Feds. I would bet not even half the deaths file the last month are Corona. It’s all a Hoax. The hospitals get $39,000 if they put a patient on a Ventilator. And the ventilators are killing people.

Anthony Walsh As doctor Eric Nepute said on a live Facebook stream! Covid19 deaths are rising and deaths by heart diseases and others have declined massively!! Apparently people don’t die from heart attacks or other deaths now!
It’s so sad how they are blaming everything on covid19!! Their was a article about a 1day old that died from coronavirus, come to find out that 1day old was born 22 weeks early! The baby didn’t die from coronavirus the baby died bc it couldn’t survive being born 22 weeks early! Also a 1 year old died and it was blamed on covid19 the parents so no my baby did not die bc if the virus he died from a injury he got at home! They are literally blaming everything on covid19 and we as Americans shouldn’t allow it! A professor said that the more logic fatality rate is less than 1%

Jody Estok This virus is real but it's not worse than the regular flu! In most cases it's far better!!! This was all created in the Wuhan lab! The seafood market never sold bats and the protein that causes animal to human jump was never present

Ricky Love Hospitals are now listing majority of deaths as covid even if it's not confirmed, the data isnt accurate enough for this type of statistical analysis.

Justin Wagenhals Only because anyone who dies and is positive is listed as covid for cause of death. if you have pulminary issues and die of a heart attack after catching the flu the heart attack killed you not that the flu killed you.

Sherry Byerline
Sherry Byerline No cancer and heart disease are still killing among other things but it's being listed as covid 19 to further the agenda of pushing a new untested vaccine on the people not knowing the short or long-term effects , it will probably kill more than all other things in the long run . POPULATION CONTROL is Bill Gates agenda and he is funding the vaccine . ITS A BIG NOOOO FOR ME.

John Powers Every death is attributed to coronavirus. It is to keep the death numbers up and us imprisoned in our homes. Americans are going to get tired of forced unemployment and imprisonment real soon. If the government doesn't ease up and let us get back to work, we should ignore the government and go about our business.
