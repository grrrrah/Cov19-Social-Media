Randy Oliver The Federal government was never meant to be the primary provider of assistance. State and local governments know their communities much better than the Feds, and they can more easily manage the infrastructure and logistics to provide the support services to meet the needs of their residents. The Feds are best equipped to assist in coordination and provide additional financial support. Blaming the Feds just shows Mayor Pete’s lack of understanding of how our system is intended to work.

Jennifer Hedge Ridge
Jennifer Hedge Ridge The states that are struggling had poor leadership to begin with... that's why they are struggling. They are the ones that always have their hands out for a bailout because they mismanage their own responsibilities. If they had their own crap together and had a plan in place then the federal government could pick up and help out in a supplemental way not in a primary manner. That's called socialism when you expect the federal government to handle all aspects of your life... and that has been real pleasant for all of us hasn't it? Groceries and supplies rationed, people struggling out of work, being told when and where we are allowed to go, propaganda from the mainstream media 24/7. This is a great way to live 🙄. How about everyone do their part (state and local levels) so we aren't completely dependent on one division (feds). This is what happens when the generation of everyone gets a participation trophy "leads".

Beth Lee He has it backwards. States are supposed to govern themselves, including preparing to handle these sorts of situations. The federal govt steps in to provide aid when it has to. If states weren’t sufficiently prepared, it’s not the federal government’s fault. Many think Trump is doing as good or better than anyone else probably could in his situation.

Yvonne Wilson This may be a lesson from God. He’s showing us what living with socialism would be. Government controlling us, telling us when we may leave our house and only for an essential. No work, no school, no friends, no celebrations. Total government control. So, when this lesson is over,
Maybe we’ve all learned we don’t ever want to be a socialist country. God is a great teacher!!

There were not many states that were prepared as they should have been so they all landed in the federal lap. We pay state taxes and those taxes are used to provide our state with among other things supplies for a pandemic. Governors have one state to take care of........President Trump had 40+ states demanding supplies.......so because the individual states failed to do their jobs the President had to tap all taxpayers to pickup the tap for you slackers. STOP BLAMING THE PRESIDENT. IT'S THE STATES FAULT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A STOCKPILE OF SUPPLIES. No wonder your citizens said you were/are a horrible mayor. Not knowing what you are responsible for says alot about your capabilities as a political leader.

Christopher Janson
Christopher Janson Well thats because it is the states responsibility.. FEMA & govt ONLY come to aide in a declared National Emergency. So now this National Emergency is x50 states simultaneously. The specific needs (supplies) of this national emergency are PPE & ventilators. Neither were in supply for the magnitide & scope that the every state needed ABOVE their own pitiful supply. A complete failure across the board. Even the hospitals lacked supplies.
Keep in mind.
Obama warned states back in early 2010 about this when the H1N1 flu pandemic (swine flu) hit the United States. Although he specifically was 'responsible' for replenishing the national supply, which the Obama administration (& Trump administration) also failed to do as the DHHS taskforce requested/suggested.
What did states do about it ? Well that answer is so very evident now. Zip zero. Nada. Nil. Nothing.
Stop the political blame game. Move along...

Who takes credit for any thing good and takes no responsibility for anything bad. Who is more concerned about his ratings instead of his citizens.

Dana Jackson you need to read the constitutuion Pete...the states are supposed to do it for themselves ..not the federal government...if our Governor of Mich...had done the right thing from the beginning we would have been more prepared....She thinks Lotto tickets and Booze are more important than people taking care of their homes. I have no respect for her at all..

Patrick Okey The global pandemic is a national disaster. As such, national leadership and coordination of a response is needed. Absent such, you have states competing for the same scarce resources and making decisions that may be harmful to other states. Put the the “United” back in the United States of America.

Edward Crowson It is time to work together, quit whining, quit blaming the President for your incompetence, if the governors can't manage one state how do they expect one person to manage all of them? Each state will have different needs as well as each city will have their needs.The President pledged his support if the states have any problems.

Carl Guglielmino He cant do the thinking for everyone. If you have a governor that does not have the brain power to decide and cancel a large event like Mardi Gras, and others blocking doctors from using a drug to treat their patients in the best way possible, then President Trump may have to do their jobs for them!!!! Please get rid of these liberal nutjobs and elect people who dont blame others for their inadequecies.

Drew Dallons If a city in Ohio was attacked by nuclear weapons, would it then be the state governor's responsibility to react and respond? No, it is the federal government's responsibility, moreover, the Executive Branch's responsibility to protect America and American interests. A pandemic that impacts every state is an attack that threatens American interests, not just individual states.

Victor Martin Runge Well, Pete: read the Constitution. In our Republic, the states have responsibility for their citizens before Federal responsibility kicks in, and state constitutions generally delegate primary responsibility to local authorities.
Go back to civics class and maybe learn something.

It’s unbelievable that someone who was running to be president and maybe came distantly close to being the flag bearer for his party knows little about the structure of the USA or is this just a deliberate shot at DJT just because it’s him at the helm? If the latter is the case it is pathetic.

James Anastasio Why do we always have to depend on the Federal Government to do all the work. When are we going to elect local official who can run a state like a business and have ready the items we may need. Instead of politicians who only know how to write laws that make no sense.

Heather Rock-Iaconis Government is supposed to work like this...local government, state then federal. It is your job as mayor to run your city. The state runs all the cities, then the federal government oversees the states. President Trump is not your mommy. You need to take responsibility, not place blame on someone else for your incompetence.

The Federal Government helps the States it's up to City Mayor's and the Govenor to coordinate to serve the State. Federal assist the State!!! Quit whining!!!

Lois Walston Seems to me Mr. Buttigieg has his own failures to worry about. The turmoil in the South Bend Police Department still lingers for the new mayor which took place under Mr. Buttigieg's leadership when he was in office. Or maybe the Federal Government was supposed to resolve that for him too.
