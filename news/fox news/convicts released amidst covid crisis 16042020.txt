Elizabeth Olsiewicz I met one in a bus station. He was headed to ElPaso. I gave him a lunch I had to packed for my brother who never showed up. He was like oh God not peanut butter and jelly. I ate those for 4 months in jail.
He did like the 2 oranges.
I said well next time you even think about breaking the law think of those pB and J sandwiches. He assured me he was goi g to get a job in El Paso.
